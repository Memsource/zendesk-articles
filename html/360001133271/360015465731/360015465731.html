<p><strong>Approved Terms for Easier Identification</strong></p>
<p>With the release of this feature, <em>New </em>terms will be marked in grey while the <em>Approved</em> terms will remain black. This is already available in the Web Editor. </p>

<p>Until now, it was only possible to distinguish between <em>New</em> and <em>Approved</em> terms using the metadata details at the bottom of the CAT pane:</p>

<p><strong>Marking Terms as Preferred and Having Preferred Terms Displayed First in CAT Pane</strong></p>
<p>The Desktop Editor now supports marking terms as <em>Preferred</em> when creating a term base entry. Also, a preferred target term for a source term will be positioned above any other term associated with that source term in the <em>CAT</em> Pane.</p>
