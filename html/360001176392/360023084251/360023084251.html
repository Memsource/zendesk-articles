<h2><span class="wysiwyg-color-black">New Features and Improvements</span></h2>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-black"><strong>Linguists now Distinguished from Providers</strong></span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-black" style="font-weight: 400;">Linguists and Providers are now distinguished from each other in the Memsource UI. Previously, Memsource would ask users to select Linguists to be assigned to a job. However, this did not take into consideration that other vendors might be assigned to a job. The new UI distinguishes these two roles to help users to select the most appropriate person for a job.</span></p>

<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-black">When an automation widget has connectors assigned, an <strong>Add from Online Repository </strong>button now appears. The button will only appear if the widget has connectors that are assigned.</span></p>

<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-black">Providers can now see how much they will get for a job in the <em>Quotes</em> section. Project Managers can assign the quote to a provider using the drop-down menu.</span></p>

<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-black"><strong>New Connector—Contentful</strong></span></p>

<li><span class="wysiwyg-color-black">Environments</span></li>

<h2><span class="wysiwyg-color-black">Fixed Bugs</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><span class="wysiwyg-color-black">Occasionally, jobs would not finish loading when uploading a zip file after a project's creation. This has now been resolved.</span></li>
<li><span class="wysiwyg-color-black">When multiple files were imported into a single project that had no workflow steps, the total price displayed would be correct, but sometimes the prices for the individual files would not be. This has now been resolved.</span></li>
</ul>
