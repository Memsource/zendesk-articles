<h2 id="New_Features_and_Improvements">Fixed Bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>When using a Mac, switching between the <em>More, QA, Changes, </em>and <em>CAT </em>Panes using Ctrl + Tab would not always work. This has now been fixed.  </li>
<li>Previously, there was a QA error called <em>Trailing spaces</em>. Since there is already a <em>Leading/Trailing spaces </em>error, the <em>Trailing spaces </em>error has been removed.</li>
</ul>
