<p>Memsource can be used to convert a previously translated text into a translation memory even if it was not translated in any CAT tool. In order to do this, you need to have both the original and the translated files, and they need to be in in the same format. See our list of supported <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000446911-Supported-File-Formats">file formats</a>.</p>
<p>You can upload these files into Memsource using the Align feature in either a <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010849432-Creating-a-Translation-Memory">new TM</a> or an existing one. Click on the TM's name and go to the <em>Import/Export</em> section. Then, click on <strong>Align</strong>. Memsource will split the text into segments and will attempt to align the original segments with the translated segments.</p>
<p>You can then download this new file as an XLSX file, check the alignment, and <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011103391-Import-content-to-Translation-Memory">import</a> it to a Memsource translation memory. Don't worry—we'll explain exactly how to do all of this below.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is possible to align single file pairs or batches of files (in ZIP folders).</p>
<h2>Aligning Files</h2>
<p>To launch the alignment dialogue window, select the TM to which you wish to import the content, and then click on the <strong>Align</strong> button.<br> <img class="img350" title="Align files" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/sqlm9c9fw2h4zl7/TM_align_button.png?raw=1" alt="Align files"></p>
<p>You will see two options: <em>1 source + 1 target file... </em>and <em>Multiple files...</em></p>
<h3>1 Source + 1 Target File</h3>
<p>Once you click <em>1 source + 1 target file..., </em>you'll see a window that asks you to upload both files.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Depending on your permissions, you may or may not have the <em>Segmentation rules </em>fields shown below.</p>
<p><img class="img350" title="Select files for alignment" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ksrin2zvvj99qjs/TM_align_select_files.png?raw=1" alt="TM_align_select_files.png"></p>
<p>The <strong>Language </strong>field must be filled in. The drop-down menu should give you the list of target languages that your TM contains. Select the one that matches the translated file you want to align. Upload that file in the <em>Translation</em> section of this window. Upload the original under the <em>Original </em>section and click <strong>Align.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Make sure you upload your files into the correct places. If, for example, you're translating from English to Spanish, select <em>Spanish</em> in the <strong>Language</strong> section and upload the Spanish translation there. If you upload the English file in this section, the alignment will be reversed.</p>
<h3>Multiple Files</h3>
<p>This option is useful for aligning multiple files at once. The file pairs (source/target) must have identical names and should be imported in a zip file with folders named <strong>"source"</strong> and <strong>"target"</strong> containing the corresponding files.<br> <img title="ZIP file structure" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/tl0kwkgq7p7wnks/TM_align_zip_structure.png?raw=1" alt="TM_align_zip_structure.png"></p>
<p>Once you have your files set up, click the <strong>Align</strong> button. Click <strong>Choose File </strong>or drag your ZIP file into the field next to the button. In the <em>Translation </em>field, select the target language for your TM and click <strong>Align. </strong></p>
<h2>Download the Results as an XLSX File</h2>
<p>Whether you aligned two files or multiple files, once you click <strong>Align,</strong> the files will be imported into Memsource and segmented. The content will then be aligned and inserted into an XLSX file. This file will be offered for download (or automatically saved, depending on your web browser settings).<br> <img class="img350" title="Download XLSX" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/on1rn0ox6cn4zkc/TM_align_download%20XLSX.png?raw=1" alt="TM_align_download_XLSX.png"></p>
<p>Save this file into your computer. Then, open it and check the alignment.</p>
<p>This XLSX file has the structure needed to import it directly into your Memsource TM. There are three columns marking the source language, target language, and the filename of the target file.</p>
<p>The file can be further edited in MS Excel and then directly <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011103391-Importing-Content-to-a-Translation-Memory">imported</a> into the TM using the <strong>Import</strong> button.</p>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<p>We recommend you create a separate translation memory for the aligned segments (it could even be called <em>Aligned TM</em>). This makes it much easier to distinguish between the segments originating from the alignment and the actual translation work.</p>
<p>Also, you might find that the results of the alignment process are not quite satisfactory. This can be caused for a number of reasons—differences in content, incorrectly set segmentation, inconsistent formatting in the source and target files, etc.</p>
<p>You can help your translators by adding the aligned Excel file as a reference to the project. This way, if translators get a match for their source text which obviously contains something incorrectly aligned in the target, they can open the MS Excel file attached as a reference. They could then look up the correct result in the target column (it will be located somewhere near the original segment).</p>
