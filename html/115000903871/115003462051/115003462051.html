<div>The desktop version of Memsource Editor is available for working offline. However, you will have limited access to the resources (such as TMs, TBs, or machine translation) and to Quality Assurance (QA).</div>
<div>
<br>The following process can be used to work offline when your internet connection is temporarily down, when you are traveling, etc. Otherwise, using the desktop editor online is recommended since an internet connection is necessary in order to use the project's TM, TB or MT, run QA checks, and save the translation to the server. In addition, the Preview feature is only available online.</div>

<div>
<strong>Step 1:</strong> <a href="https://www.memsource.com/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download Memsource Editor for desktop use</a> and install it on your computer.<br><br>
</div>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Log in to your <a href="https://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Linguist_Portal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linguist Portal</a> and pre-translate your MXLIFF file through the Memsource <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003691852-Jobs#Pre-translate_1">pre-translate feature</a>. You can set any pre-translate threshold you want (only available if there is a TM assigned to the project).<br><br> <img src="https://relianta.sirv.com/AI-powered%20NTs/Pre-translate-option-Cloud.png" alt="" width="471" height="226"></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Download the pre-translated MXLIFF file and start translating in Memsource Editor.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Here, you can go offline. You will still be able to translate and have segments with some TM matches already pre-translated (but you will not have TM, TB, or MT matches in the <em>CAT</em> Pane).</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: </strong>After you are back online, log in. (When successful, you'll see a green Login Indicator in the bottom right-hand corner of your Memsource Editor.) Click on <strong>Document </strong>and select <strong>Upload to Server. </strong>This will ensure that all of your content is uploaded to Memsource. Be sure to check the status in the bottom right-hand corner of the Desktop Editor window.<br> <img src="https://relianta.sirv.com/Desktop%20Editor/translating%20offline.jpg?scale.width=700" alt="" width="699" height="291"></p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>If the Linguist user is working offline in the desktop editor and uploads the bilingual MXLIFF file in Memsource by clicking on <strong>Upload</strong> in <strong>Tools</strong>, the segments are automatically saved to the TM.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: </strong>The translation can be also uploaded in your Linguist Portal (by going to <strong>Tools</strong> and clicking on <strong>Upload</strong>) or sent via email to your Project Manager who can then upload it for you.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7: </strong>Don't forget to run a QA check and to resolve all problems before setting the job to                         Completed.</p>

<h2>Reasons Why an MXLIFF File Could Not be Uploaded</h2>
<ul>
<li>The MXLIFF has broken
<ul>
<li>This can happen if, for example, it was translated in another CAT tool. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The MXLIFF belongs to a different project
<ul>
<li>Sometimes translators misunderstand the workflow in Memsource. They create their own projects and then try to add their MXLIFF files to their clients' accounts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The MXLIFF belongs to a different workflow step.
<ul>
<li>The MXLIFF file should always be added to the same workflow step that it was exported from.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The job has been deleted
<ul>
<li>The job into which the MXLIFF file belongs has been deleted, but the translator has continued to translate the deleted MXLIFF file. Because the job was deleted, the connection between the server and the MXLIFF file was lost (you cannot connect to deleted jobs). The translator must have therefore worked offline (the square indicators in the bottom right corner were red).</li>
<li>The solution for this is on the PM's side. Locate the deleted job in the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003683051-Recycle-Bin">Recycle Bin</a> by going to <strong>Settings</strong> on the Memsource page and clicking on <strong>Recycle Bin </strong>in the <em>Tools</em> section. Undelete the job and ask the translator to upload his/her MXLIFF to update the (previously deleted) job.</li>
</ul>
