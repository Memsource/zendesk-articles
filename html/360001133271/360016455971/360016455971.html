<h2>New Features and Improvements</h2>
<p><strong>Improving Support for Bi-directional Texts in In-context Preview</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, right-to-left (RTL) texts remained aligned to the left despite the text direction being reversed. With this release, the support for bi-directional texts has been improved. Now, in the in-context preview, texts will be aligned according to the direction of the selected language.</span></p>
