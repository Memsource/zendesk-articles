<h2>Fixed Bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>When confirming the last segment in a job or a filtered selection of segments, the cursor jumps to the beginning of the segment rather than the end as would be expected. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>When preferences specify that cursor should move to next unconfirmed segment upon confirmation of the previous, this does not happen. This has been fixed.</li>
</ul>
