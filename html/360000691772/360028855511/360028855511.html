<p>Salesforce Knowledge is an online content management system that helps businesses with their marketing, sales, and commerce needs.</p>
<h2>Salesforce Knowledge Connector Use Cases</h2>
<p>There are a number of use cases for the connector:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li>Project Managers can <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003483992" target="_self">add files directly to projects from an online repository</a>
</li>
<li>Set up the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003941812" target="_self">Automation Widget</a> so Submitters can add files to requests directly from the online repository.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003460931" target="_self">Automated Project Creation</a> to have Memsource automatically create new projects when a change in the last modified date is detected for monitored files or a folder.
<ul>
<li>Selected files are imported the very first time APC runs. All files are imported when a folder is monitored.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <a href="https://cloud.memsource.com/web/docs/api#tag/Connector" target="_self">Connector API</a> can be used to automate steps otherwise performed manually through the UI. <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004209771" target="_self">Webhooks</a> can be used to have Memsource notify 3rd party systems about certain events (for example, a job status change).</li>
</ul>
<p>Restrictions: </p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li>
<strong>Source language</strong> of Memsource's project must match the <strong>Default </strong>language of Salesforce Knowledge configured in <em>Knowledge Settings</em>. <em>English</em> in Salesforce is actually <em>English (United States)</em> full locale. </li>
<li>
<strong>Target languages</strong> of the project must be a subset of Knowledge target languages.</li>
<li>Articles must be published before they are sent to Memsource for translation. The connector does not work with articles saved as drafts.</li>
</ul>
