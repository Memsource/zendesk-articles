<p>In addition to the translation memory, you may also want to add a term base (TB) to your project. A term base is a glossary or database of terms that helps to maintain terminology consistency in your translations. This is especially helpful when, for example, you have more than one translator working on the same project. For more detailed information on term bases, please click <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003681851-Term-Bases">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>As with translation memories, you will be able to create TBs using either the <strong>New</strong> button on the <em>Term Bases </em>page or by clicking on the plus sign <strong>(+)</strong> in the navigation panel. If you're already on your new project's page, simply click on <strong>Create New.</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Fill in the following mandatory fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Name</strong>
<ul>
<li>Give your new term base a name. Remember that you will be able to use it for other projects later on as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Languages</strong>
<ul>
<li>Unlike translation memories or projects, term bases are not created for specific language pairs and can contain a variety of languages.<br>  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Click the <strong>Create </strong>button at the bottom to complete the setup of your term base.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Existing term bases can be <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003681851-Term-Bases">imported</a> into Memsource using TBX or XLSX file formats. To add a TB to a language, go to the <em>Term Bases</em> section of your project. There, you will see the language codes for each language in your project and the name of the TB that you created in Memsource. Click on the name of the term base you created in Memsource to add a previously created TB. Even though you've only clicked on one language, this will still apply the TB to all languages.</p>
<p>As you did with the translation memory, click on the <strong>Import </strong>button. Click <strong>Choose File</strong> and select your TB. Once it appears in the box next to the <strong>Choose File</strong> button, click <strong>Import.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>If you choose to import an Excel sheet as your TB, make sure to use the appropriate <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003929811-Supported-Languages">language codes</a> in the first row, representing the different languages in the columns below.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Step 5: </strong>To use the term base from a previous project, simply navigate to the project in question and click <strong>Select </strong>to attach the appropriate TB. You can learn more about working with projects in <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001721891-Lesson-1-How-to-Create-a-Project">Lesson 1</a>.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>With the term base now attached, anyone working on jobs from that project in Memsource Editor can access the terminology available in the term base.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Bonus: </strong>You can also add new terms to a term base from Memsource Editor by selecting <strong>Tools </strong>and then clicking on <strong>Add Term</strong>.</p>
