<p>When a segment is repeated in a document, it is called a repetition. If the file is imported with a Context key, the segment is considered a repetition only if the source text and the segment's context key are the same.</p>
<p>A repetition can be easily identified in Memsource Editor, as blue arrows are displayed next to the repeated segment.</p>
<p>Once a user confirms a repeated segment, all the repeated instances of that segment below it will be updated with the confirmed translation. Please note that repetitions are only propagated downwards.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Disabling the Auto-propagation of Repetitions</span></h2>
<p>There is an option to enable/disable the auto-propagation of repetitions in the <em>Pre-translation</em> section of the general Memsource <strong>Setup</strong> by going to the <em>Project Settings </em>section and clicking on <strong>Pre-translation. </strong> Alternatively, you can change this in the <em>Pre-translation </em>section of the Project Settings page (when creating a new project or editing an existing project). By default, this option is enabled. If disabled, the blue arrows next to repeated segments are greyed out. </p>
<p>In the general Memsource Setup page under <strong>Access and Security,</strong> there is the option to decide whether Linguist users can choose to enable/disable the auto-propagation of repetitions from within the Editors. See the article on <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003460891-How-to-Be-Secure-with-Memsource-Cloud#Linguists_may_turn_on/turn_off_auto-propagation_of_repetitions">Access and Security Settings</a> for more information.</p>
<p>The auto-propagation of repetitions option can be found in the Memsource Editor by going to <strong>Tools, </strong>clicking on <strong>Preferences</strong> and selecting the CAT tab. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Segments with a different number will not get auto-propagated as they are not repetitions, but they should show a 100% match from the TM, and the number should be automatically replaced. Unfortunately, this feature is not available for languages with no spaces between words (Japanese, Chinese etc.). Also, it does not work in cases where there is some formatting difference in the segments.</p>
<h2><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Repetition Exception</span></h2>
<p>Sometimes it is necessary to introduce a "repetition exception," which allows a repeated segment to have a different translation than all the other repeated segments. This can be done by clicking on the repetition icon, which will become crossed out. This will ensure that the translation for such a segment will not change in line with the other repetitions.</p>
