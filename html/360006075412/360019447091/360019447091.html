<h2><span id="Introduction" class="mw-headline">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>Kibana is an open source workbench that allows for the visualization of data that has been previously indexed in our analytics warehouse. Kibana is currently available for the Ultimate and Enterprise editions of Memsource.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In order to process data from Memsource, Kibana version 4.1.6 is required. It can be downloaded from the official <a class="external text" style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/kibana-4-1-6" rel="nofollow">Elastic website</a> directly.</p>
<h2><span id="Downloading.2C_Installation_Start-Up" class="mw-headline">Downloading, Installation, and Start-Up</span></h2>
<ol>
<li>In your Memsource account, go to <strong>Setup </strong>and scroll down to <em>Analytics &amp; Reporting. </em>Select <strong>Kibana</strong> and click on <strong>Setup Kibana Access</strong>. This will generate a unique URL that you will need in order to visualize data with Kibana.</li>
<li>Download the correct installer for your operating system.</li>
<li>Extract the downloaded ZIP file.</li>
<li>Inside the 'config' subfolder, you will find the 'kibana.yml' configuration file. Open it using a text editor or a source code editor, such as Notepad++ or jEdit (for a clearer display of the code).</li>
<li>Replace the value of the <strong>elasticsearch_url</strong> (usually "<a class="external free" href="http://localhost:9200" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:9200</a>") with the URL you have generated in your Memsource account and make sure the <strong>kibana_index</strong> is set to <strong>.kibana</strong> like this:<br> <img class="img450" src="https://pages.memsource.com/hc/Kibana_configuration.png">
</li>
<li>Save the file.</li>
<li>To start Kibana, go to the 'bin' subdirectory in the extracted folder and double-click <strong>kibana.bat</strong> (Windows users), or <strong>kibana</strong> (other users).</li>
<li>If you have setup everything correctly, you will see this:<br> <img class="img450" src="https://pages.memsource.com/hc/Kibana_Connected.png"><br>This means that Kibana is ready for use. This command window has to stay open in order to maintain the connection to Kibana.</li>
<li>Open your browser and type <strong>localhost:5601</strong> into the address bar to access the visualization workbench.<br> <img class="img350" src="https://pages.memsource.com/hc/URL_kibana.png">
</li>
</ol>
<h2><span id="Configuring_Kibana" class="mw-headline">Configuring Kibana</span></h2>
<ol>
<li>Start Kibana as described in step 7 of the previous section.</li>
<li>When you log in for the first time, you will be prompted to configure the index patterns that you want to utilize for your visualization. Do this in <em>Settings</em> under the <em>Indices</em> menu.<br><img class="img350" src="https://pages.memsource.com/hc/Index_pattern.png"><br>The following index patterns are currently available:
<ul>
<li>com.memsource.web.analytics.data.job (job.dateCreated)</li>
<li>com.memsource.web.analytics.data.jobpart (jobPart.dateCreated)</li>
<li>com.memsource.web.analytics.data.analysis (jobPart.dateCreated)</li>
<li>com.memsource.web.analytics.data.costs (jobPart.dateCreated)</li>
<li>com.memsource.web.analytics.data.api (request.date)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When creating your indexes, the expression in brackets represent the recommended Time-field name for the given index. You can configure any or all the indexes available.</li>
<li>Once the indexes are registered, you can start visualizing the data through the Visualize tab.</li>
</ol>
<h2><span id="Classification_of_Indexes" class="mw-headline">Classification of Indexes</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Job index
<ul>
<li>Contains information about job sizes (words, pages etc.), who created the jobs, when they were created, filetypes, projects, and organizations they belong to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Job Part index
<ul>
<li>Jobs themselves do not have statuses or assigned users. This type of information is stored in terms of job parts (i.e. jobs in different workflow steps constitute different job parts). Otherwise, the same of data as in the Job index are available (filetype, project, organization etc.).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Analysis index
<ul>
<li>Information about Analyzed Job Parts (divided into match categories) with and without Net Rate applied.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Costs index
<ul>
<li>Costs for the Job Part (based on Price Lists).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>API index
<ul>
<li>Summary of API usage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Below you will find a short guide on how to create your visualization. For more information about the possible options and types of visualizations, please consult the <a class="external text" href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/index.html" rel="nofollow">Kibana User Guide</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>The <em>Visualize</em> tab allows you to choose the type of visualization you want to use. On the very bottom of the page, you can also see previously saved visualizations.</li>
<li>Select either the <strong>new</strong> or <strong>saved search</strong> option.</li>
<li>For a <strong>new</strong> search, you will be given a choice of which of the configured indexes you wish to use.</li>
<li>You will see an empty graph with various options you can select and feed into it.</li>
<li>By default, Kibana selects the interval of <em>Last 15 minutes</em>; select a different interval if needed.</li>
<li>In the left panel, you can select the metrics to use for your visualization.
<ul>
<li>The first section determines the type of data used to create the graph and the aggregation method. This graph will determine the overall number of units within the given metrics.</li>
<li>Section <strong>Buckets</strong> allows you to divide the graph based on the selected parameters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can also save the given graph if you want to avoid repetitive manual configuration</li>
</ol>
<h2>Sample Charts and Configurations</h2>
<p>You can find sample charts with their respective setup on <a title="Kibana configuration" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019133072">our dedicated page</a>.</p>
<h2>Dashboard</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can visualize the saved graphs on the Kibana Dashboard.</li>
<li>Each of the graphs set up in the Dashboard will then reflect the <em>Time Field</em> selected in the Top panel.</li>
<li>The graphs can be resized, moved, and ordered to provide an adequate view of the data.</li>
<li>Dashboards can also be saved and stored for later use.</li>
</ul>
