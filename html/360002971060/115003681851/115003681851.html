<p>Terminology can help to keep your translations consistent within your <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003680771-Projects">projects</a> and ensure you and/or your translators use the correct terms.</p>
<ul>
<li>Term bases can be multilingual and can be assigned to multiple projects.</li>
<li>The terms can be added and edited (with limits) by the Linguists during the translation process.</li>
<li>Some Linguists or Vendors might have unlimited editing rights for any term.</li>
<li>Term bases can be also accessed and edited by a Guest user (your client) if such a role is available in your subscription plan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Memsource term bases are concept-based, so a single term in a language can have one or more counterparts in another language. The term base module also supports multiple languages in a single term base.</p>
<h2>Create a New Term Base</h2>
<p>To create a new TB, either click on the <strong>New </strong>button on the <em>Term Bases </em>page or select the plus sign (<strong>+</strong>) next to <em>Term Bases </em>in the left-side menu.</p>
<ul>
<li>Enter a TB <strong>Name.</strong>
</li>
<li>Select <strong>the languages</strong> for your TB. Unlike translation memories, term bases do not make a distinction between source and target languages. A term base can have multiple languages, but for the sake of speed and ease of editing, a maximum of 10-15 languages is recommended. Using 30 languages in a TB is still manageable, but more than 50 languages can cause your TB to become very slow and very hard to work with.</li>
<li>You can select the <em>Client, Business Unit, Domain, </em>and <em>Subdomain</em> (if applicable to your Memsource Edition and the account settings).</li>
<li>You can also add a <strong>Note</strong><em> </em>if you desire.</li>
<li>Hit the <strong>Create</strong> button.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Create a New Term</h2>
<p>Please see a dedicated article <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021934312" target="_self">Create and Edit Terms</a>.</p>
<h2>Term Base Management</h2>
<p>Terms can be searched, filtered, edited, imported, or exported in the Memsource <em>Term Bases</em> section.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>New</em> terms (not <em>Approved </em>terms) are displayed in grey.</li>
<li>Forbidden terms are displayed in red.</li>
<li>The <em>Term Concept </em>(source term, target term, synonyms) is displayed as a block of rows distinguished with white and blue background colors.</li>
<li>The term's attributes are displayed in columns that can be customized by clicking on the <em>gear</em> icon in the top right corner.</li>
<li>The term concept can be deleted by selecting the checkbox next to the term and clicking on the <strong>Delete</strong> button.</li>
<li>Individual terms can be deleted by clicking on the red <strong>X</strong> icon next to the term. Please note that deleted terms cannot be recovered.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Search and Filter in a Term Base</h3>
<p>Use the <strong>Search</strong> button to search for a TB term in the selected language. By default, a <a title="Wildcard search" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003929891">wildcard search</a> is used. For an exact search, use quotation marks (such as "red car").</p>
<p>It is possible to <strong>Filter</strong> the searched results using the <em>funnel</em> icon in the top right corner. The filters will appear at the top as a row of fields that can be used to narrow your search. (See the <em>gear</em> icon for a list of columns that can be displayed.)</p>
<p>A new search will reset the filter, you should use <strong>Search</strong> before using the <strong>Filter.</strong></p>
<h2>Importing Terminology</h2>
<p>Terms can be imported from XLS/XLSX and TBX files into a term base. When importing terms, you can decide whether they should be imported as a new term base or if they should be added to an existing term base. For more details, see our <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021885672-Importing-Terminology-into-a-Term-Base" target="_self">Import Content to a Term Base</a> article.</p>
<h2>Update Terminology</h2>
<p>This feature is useful to modify existing terms that are already in a Memsource term base. To do this, just follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Export the terms by clicking on the <strong>Export</strong> button and selecting the attributes that you wish to export. The <em>Concept ID (CID), Term ID (TID), </em>and the <em>Term </em>must be exported. By default, <em>Status </em>is also selected. You can decide to import the <em>Status</em> or not, and you can export any of the other attributes listed here as well.</li>
<li>Make the desired changes in MS Excel—be careful not to delete the CIDs and TIDs.</li>
<li>You can delete terms in one of two ways. Add the suffix <strong>|delete </strong>to the CID to delete it from all languages, or add <strong>|delete </strong>to the TID to delete it from a specific language.</li>
<li>Save the MS Excel file.</li>
<li>Re-import the Excel file. <strong>Important: </strong>before you click on <strong>Import, </strong>make sure you have the option <strong>Update existing terms</strong> selected.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Export Terminology</h2>
<p>To export the Terminology, open the Term Base, scroll down to the Import / Export section and click on the Export button. You can select a TMX or XLS format and you can also filter the exported terms by their Concept's attributes Domain and Subdomain.</p>
<p><img class="img350" title="Export TB as TMX" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/4f5p47e63i8fzfj/TB_exportWindow.png?raw=1" alt="Export TB as TMX"></p>
<h4>Export an XLS</h4>
<p>XLS format is useful for editing - you can open it in Excel and easily edit any text. When exporting into an XLSX, select which term attributes you wish to have exported.</p>
<h4>Export a TBX</h4>
<p>The TBX format is ideal if you need to import TB to another CAT tool or if you'd like import/export terminology between two Memsource term bases. This is because the TBX format is lossless inside the Memsource environment.</p>
