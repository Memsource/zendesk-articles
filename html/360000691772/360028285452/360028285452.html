<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note that this connector only supports Microsoft OneDrive. OneDrive for Business is not supported at this time.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set up the Connector</span></h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You will need to have pop-ups enabled in your browser.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before setting up the </span><a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003948452-Connectors"><span style="font-weight: 400;">connector</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Memsource, you'll want to log in to your OneDrive account. Being logged into OneDrive will allow Memsource to get your account information during the setup process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Navigate to Setup and scroll down to the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrations </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">section.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you haven’t logged into your Microsoft OneDrive account yet, you’ll see a pop-up asking you for your OneDrive login information. If you are already logged in, this step will be automatically skipped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pop-up you see will now ask you to allow Memsource to access the information in your OneDrive account. Click on </span><strong>Yes. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve done this, you should see a small check mark next to the </span><strong>Connect to OneDrive </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">button. Click on </span><strong>Save.</strong></p>
