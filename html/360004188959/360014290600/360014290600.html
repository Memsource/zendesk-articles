<a id="UUID-8f024270-e427-b27c-acd9-d548869bb57c_bridgehead-idm231833745714633"></a>Character Set</h3>
<p>It may be necessary to specify the appropriate <a class="link" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/intl/code-page-identifiers?redirectedfrom=MSDN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">character set</a> when importing zip files:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem"><p>Character sets must be specified for text-type file formats such as .txt or .csv files. If not specified, Memsource assumes they are encoded in UTF-8.</p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>The encoding of file names in zip files should be specified. This may vary from the usual Windows encoding.</p>
<p>Zip file names are encoded using a different encoding method than the actual files are. For example, IBM852 is typically used for Czech and IBM866 is typically used for Russian on Windows systems. This may vary depending on the producer of the zip file software.</p>
<p>To select the character set when importing the zip file (creating a new job), click on Character Set - Encoding of the zipped file names and choose the appropriate character set. If the character set is incorrect, some file names (although not the actual files) may be misinterpreted during importation.</p>
