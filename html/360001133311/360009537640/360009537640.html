<p><strong>Concept-level Metadata for Term Bases</strong></p>
<p>In the <em>Edit Concept</em> section under <em>Edit Term</em>, concept-level metadata can be added for terms in term bases. It is possible to specify the <em>Domain, Subdomain, URL, Definition, </em>and <em>Concept Note</em>. Such concept-level metadata is now also displayed within the Memsource Editor in the CAT Pane metadata section.</p>

<h2 id="New_Features_and_Improvements">Fixed Bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Due to a bug, scores would be shown for NT segments, even if this feature was turned off. This has now been fixed.</li>
<li>When confirming a segment after using a filter (e.g. "not locked" or "not confirmed), the cursor would not always jump to the next unconfirmed segment. This has been resolved.</li>
</ul>
