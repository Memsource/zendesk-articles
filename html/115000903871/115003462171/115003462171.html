<p>While Memsource Editors (Desktop and Web) are connected to the server, users can add comments and create conversation threads about an entire segment (using per-segment comments) or a section of a segment (using in-line comments).</p>
<p>The Conversation feature allows cooperation between all active users involved in a job (Linguists, Project Managers, Guests). A comment made in one step is visible across all steps providing communication throughout the workflow.</p>
<p>If enabled, Conversations include the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003632531" target="_self">Language Quality Assessment</a> (LQA) feature allowing users to evaluate segments or a section of a segment based on the type of issue and severity.</p>
<p>Conversations can be exported to Memsource <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003461491" target="_self">Bilingual DOCX</a> and opened in a DOCX editor. Conversations in Bilingual DOCX are read-only and any changes made in the file will not be imported back to the Memsource job. LQA values are not exported to the Bilingual DOCX.</p>
