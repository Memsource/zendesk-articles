<p>We built our company by listening to customers. We take the feedback seriously and review every single request.</p>
<p>Memsource is a comprehensive software platform used by thousands of organizations. That means we receive a lot of valuable feedback and suggestions. Unfortunately, we cannot follow through on every request and we need to say ‘no’ more than we would like to.</p>
<p>While we don’t publish our product roadmap, we do want to be transparent about how we handle your requests.</p>
<p>Note that this policy does not apply to bugs.</p>
<h2>How to Submit a Feature Request</h2>
<p>All feature requests should be submitted by opening a <a href="http://get-help.memsource.com" target="_self">support ticket</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select <em>New feature request</em> as the <strong>Request type</strong>.</li>
<li>Ensure all the details about the feature are included. Provide examples or use cases to demonstrate the need for the feature.</li>
<li>CC the Solution Architect or Account Manager if you have one assigned.</li>
<li>Create separate posts for separate feature requests. This is very helpful in providing better tracking.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Happens After Submitting a Request</h2>
<p>Our support engineer may:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask for additional information.</li>
<li>Propose an alternative approach or a workaround.</li>
<li>Find out if the development isn’t already in place.</li>
<li>Determine that such a request cannot be accommodated.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the request has been previously vetted by a Solution Architect and they've been copied on it, the support engineer will skip this review process.</p>
<p>After the support team confirms the request is valid they submit the ticket to the product team for prioritization.</p>
<h2>How We Prioritize Requests</h2>
<p>We take a number of factors into consideration when prioritizing future development, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product strategy - requests need to be aligned with our long-term strategic vision.</li>
<li>Demand - are there other customers who requested or would benefit from similar functionality?</li>
<li>Level of effort - simple requests have shorter implementation time than complex features.</li>
<li>Availability of our team and resources.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Track What Is Happening to a Request</h2>
<p>After the request is evaluated by the product team its status will be updated as per the following:</p>
<table class="table table--color-header table--bordered">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Status</strong></td>
<td><strong>Description</strong></td>
<td><strong>Your Help Center ticket status</strong></td>
