<p>Paligo is a content authoring platform which focuses on the creation and management of technical documentation. The integration (created by Paligo) allows users to directly submit articles created with Paligo into Memsource projects and deliver the translations back into Paligo. You can also find instructions on the <a class="external text" href="https://help.paligo.net/en/translating-with-memsource.html?2018032706" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Paligo official site</a>.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>Paligo integration, similar to other 3rd party systems connecting to Memsource, uses APIs and therefore it is subjected to the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003485012-APIs-for-all-Editions">daily API call limitations</a>. </p>
<p>In order to translate content in Memsource, users need to create a Memsource project first and then insert the project ID into the <strong>Integrations </strong>section of their Paligo account. This means that all the content sent for translation will be submitted into this one specific project.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Create a project in your Memsource account. </p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Copy the last part of the URL (e.g. web/project2/show/<strong>JdvaEeMpkooHcdfegYP7U2</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Log into your Paligo account, click on your name in the top right corner, and go to <strong>Settings.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: </strong>In the <strong>Integrations</strong> section, click on <strong>Memsource integration</strong> and fill in the required credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Insert your Memsource Project ID.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: </strong>Save your configuration.</p>
<p>Once you have these steps completed, Paligo Integration will be able to create new jobs inside the designated project.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is only the first iteration of our integration with Paligo and could possibly change in the future.</p>
<h2>Translating Content</h2>
<p>Now that you have the integration set up, you can choose to send a translation directly from Paligo to Memsource in the <em>Translation View</em>, using the <strong>Export translation</strong> option.<br> <img class="img250" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/0x7roq77j94rlnr/paligo_exportContent1.png?raw=1"></p>
<p>You'll find the option <strong>Memsource</strong> as an alternative to creating an <strong>XLIFF</strong> or <strong>PO</strong> translation package.<br><img class="img250" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/f5pg32voftha8zr/paligo_exportContent2.png?raw=1"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Click on <strong>Export</strong>, and it will turn up as a job in your Memsource account. Once the translation is completed in Memsource, open your Paligo account again and use the <strong>Import</strong> option to get the translation from Memsource back to Paligo.</p>
