<h2>New Features and Improvements</h2>
<p><strong>Display Translations From Other Target Languages</strong></p>
<p>A new tab, called <em>More,</em> has been added to the side panel of the Memsource Editor which allows translators to display other target languages’ translations for the segment they are currently working on.</p>
<p>The feature allows translators to consult the other languages' matches once those are confirmed into TMs, in order to gain more context and to increase consistency.</p>
<p>The best possible TM match (99% or higher) for other target languages included in the project is shown, while the matches coming from the project currently being worked on will have preference.</p>
<p>Such matches can be inserted into target segments in the same way as matches from the <em>CAT</em> tab.</p>

<p><strong>Improved Visual Consistency in QA</strong></p>
<p>We are constantly improving the customer experience when working with our Editor. In this spirit, we have introduced the following improvements to the Quality Assurance of Memsource:</p>
<ul>
<li>Active QA warnings are highlighted with the same color that is used for active segments in the translation table.</li>
<li>There is now improved visual connection between and orientation among warnings and related segments.</li>
<li>Instead of warning sequence numbers, the QA warnings list shows the corresponding segment numbers; the QA warnings concerning the same segment are grouped together.</li>
<li>When a QA warning is activated in the QA list, the respective segment in the translation table is activated and scrolled to and vice versa.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fixed Bugs</h2>

<li>The results of the concordance search did not include results from the TB. This has now been fixed.</li>
