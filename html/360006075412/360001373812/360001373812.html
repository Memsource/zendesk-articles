<p>Price lists are used for calculating the Quotes that are used in <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003941812" rel="noopener">Automation Widgets</a> (via <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001388091" rel="noopener">Services</a>).</p>
<p>In the Ultimate and Enterprise editions, Quotes can be also created manually from Analyses. In this case, the Price List can be pre-selected in the Project or in Project Template in the <em>Financial</em> section.</p>
<p>Price lists can be created or edited in <strong>Setup</strong> and clicking on <strong>Price Lists </strong>in the<strong> </strong><em>Financials </em>section.</p>
<p>There is a <em>Default Price List (EUR)</em> and<em> Default Price List (USD)</em> prepared by Memsource, which you can edit to your liking. Or, you can create a new price list. Do this by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the <strong>New </strong>button.</li>
<li>Give your Price List a Name.</li>
<li>Decide if this Price list will be used as the Default or not.</li>
<li>Select a Currency.</li>
<li>Select Billing Units (character, word, or page).</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Save.</strong>
</li>
<li>Additional Price list setting will be displayed: Add Rows, Delete Rows, Import, and Export.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Add Rows</strong> and select the Source and Target Languages for which you wish to add rates. Then, click on the <strong>Add</strong> button. Multiple rows can be created by selecting multiple source/target languages.</li>
<li>Add a price for each language combination and workflow step (if applicable to your Memsource Edition).</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Save,</strong> and your price list is ready for use.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the Price List is created, it can be edited and Cloned (using the <strong>Clone</strong> button on the <em>Edit</em> page).</p>
<p>The Price List can also be exported into XLSX and imported (in the same format) into another Price list.</p>
