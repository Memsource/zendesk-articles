<li>Keyboard shortcuts on Mac OS sometimes collided with the Option shortcuts used by the operating system. This issue has now been fixed.</li>
<li>When using the Globalese MT engine, the TM matches did not correctly show all of the available information. This bug is now resolved. </li>
<li>Entering a new line into a segment sometimes caused the cursor to become unresponsive. This has been fixed. </li>
