<p>WordPress is an open-source blogging and web content management system. It also supports mailing lists, forums, media galleries, analytics, and online stores. <br></p>
<p>By installing the Memsource plugin, users are able to translate blog posts, pages, tags, and categories. In a project you can manually select pages for translation and then manually upload them back to your WordPress site, or you can configure <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003460931-Automated-Project-Creation">Automated Project Creation</a> and download / upload the files automatically.<br></p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>WordPress Version: 3.7 or higher<br></li>
<li>PHP Version: 5.6 or higher<br></li>
<li>WPML Plugin: Version 3.7 or higher</li>
</ul>
<h2>Supported Text Types</h2>
<p>Memsource can translate the following text from WordPress:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Posts</li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">Tags </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Categories</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Custom post types</li>
</ul>
<p>Content from WordPress will always be imported as HTML files.</p>
<h2>WPML Plugin for WordPress</h2>
<p>Your WordPress website will need a <a href="https://wpml.org/">WPML</a> plugin to create and manage multilingual pages. These pages are then used by the Memsource WordPress Plugin. Version 3.7 or higher of WPML Multilingual CMS is required.</p>
<p>Languages in WPML must match the languages of the Memsource project. To support local variations such as <em>French (Canada)</em>, define the languages in the WPML panel inside WordPress.</p>
<h2>Set up the Memsource Plugin in WordPress</h2>
<h3>Connector</h3>
<p>To set up a new <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003948452-Connectors">connector</a>, go to <strong>Memsource</strong> in the left-hand navigation panel, click <strong>Connector,</strong> and then click <strong>Show Connector settings</strong>. </p>

<h3>Translatable Content</h3>
<p>The Memsource Translation Plugin for WordPress includes a Translatable Content page. The Custom fields section lists all the custom fields included in a WordPress site. Users can choose which custom fields from this list should be exported from WordPress and translated in Memsource. </p>
<p>Â </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> All custom fields are selected for export into Memsource by default.</p>
<h3>Language Mapping</h3>
<p>The Memsource Translation Plugin for WordPress includes a language mapping page. This is where users must map their preferred WPML language codes to Memsource. The language codes on the mapping page and those in Memsource need to match for the Memsource WordPress Connector to work properly. See our list of all the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003929811-Supported-Languages%5C">supported language codes</a> in Memsource.</p>
<p><img class="img550" src="https://pages.memsource.com/hc/Connectors_Wordpress_langMapping.png"></p>
<h3>Shortcodes</h3>
<p>The Memsource Translation Plugin for WordPress includes a shortcode editor, which can be used to add custom shortcodes to those in your WordPress site. To access the shortcode editor, hover over the Memsource plugin in the left-hand navigation panel of your WordPress site and then click <strong>Shortcodes</strong>. To use the shortcode editor, a custom shortcode must first be created using a third-party shortcode plugin.</p>
<h3>Visual Page Builders</h3>
<p>The following Visual Page Builders are supported by the Memsource Translation Plugin for WordPress:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Avada</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Divi</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">WPBakery Page Builder (formerly Visual Composer)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Avia (Enfold Theme)</li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
Enfold custom fields must be deselected because they are not supported. Click on the Memsource Plugin in your WordPress account, and go to the <em>Translatable Content</em> page to deselect the Enfold custom fields. 
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Once you install a Visual Page Builder, you can view the shortcodes supported by the Memsource Plugin in the <em>Shortcodes</em> Page. The shortcodes from the Visual Page Builder cannot be modified. To access the <em>Shortcodes</em> page, hover over the Memsource plugin in the left-hand navigation panel of your WordPress site and then click <strong>Shortcodes</strong>.</p>
<h2>Set up the Plugin for WordPress in Memsource</h2>
<p>Once you have your plugin set up in WordPress, please log in to your Memsource account separately and follow the steps listed below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To set up a new connector, go to the Memsource <strong>Setup</strong> page. Under the <em>Integrations </em>section, click on <strong>Connectors</strong>, and then select <strong>New.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Select the <em>WordPress </em>option.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Add your WordPress site URL prefix to the WordPress site URL field. For example, if your WordPress admin page URL is <a href="http://blog.memsource.com/wp-admin/index.php">http://blog.memsource.com/wp-admin/index.php</a>, the prefix would be <a href="http://blog.memsource.com/">http://blog.memsource.com/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Go back to the Memsource connector page in your WordPress account and click the <em>Generate new token</em> hyperlink. Copy the resulting token and paste it into the <strong>Memsource WordPress plugin token</strong> field.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Click <strong>Test connection</strong>. Memsource should connect to your WordPress site and display a list of languages configured by the WPML plugin (as described above). If the WPML plugin is not found, an error message will appear.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: </strong>If everything is OK, <strong>Save</strong> the connector.</p>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3>What to do if Memsource Imports Text Full of Code</h3>
<p>Some Wordpress add-ons will inject code into your WordPress pages. Memsource does not handle that code out of the box and needs to be configured to properly handle this. The add-ons that are known to cause this issue are: </p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Avia Layout Builder</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Divi Builder</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Fusion Builder</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Visual Composer</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"> WPBakery (formerly Visual Composer)</li>
</ul>
<p>To configure Memsource in this case, please indicate in WordPress<a href="https://www.memsource.com/blog/2018/04/04/wordpress-plugin-choose-which-custom-fields-to-translate/"> which custom fields you wish to translate</a>. Go to <strong>Memsource Plugin</strong> in your WordPress, then <strong>Shortcodes</strong>, and add the shortcodes based on the specification of the addon format. For Bakery, the settings are shown below:</p>
