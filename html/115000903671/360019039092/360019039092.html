<p>The <em>Changes </em>Pane displays changes in a segment across all Workflow steps. The <em>Show Changes</em> and <em>Track Changes </em>features are available only for jobs that support Workflow steps (Team, Ultimate, and Enterprise editions). If no changes are available or Workflow steps are not active for a given file, the <em>Changes </em>Pane will be blank.</p>
<p>The <em>Show Changes</em> filter can also be used to filter only those segments that have changes.</p>
<h2>The Changes Pane in Memsource Editor</h2>
<p>Changes are displayed under the <em>Changes</em> Pane on the right. The top window shows the segment in all Workflow steps. The central window displays the differences in the text between the selected step and the previous step. In the example below, the selected step (highlighted in the top segment) is <em>R</em> and the difference shown is between the <em>T</em> and <em>R</em> steps. The bottom window shows metadata for the selected segment in the Workflow step.</p>

<h2>Filtering Changes</h2>
<p>The translated text can be filtered so that users can see the differences between the selected Workflow step and the previous step.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>You can create a comparative Analysis in your project. Again, this will always compare the selected Workflow step with the previous step. First, go to the Workflow step you wish to work with, then select the file(s) in question and click <strong>Analyze.</strong> Change the <strong>Type</strong> to <em>Compare</em> and select the Workflow step you want to compare it with.</p>

<p>In these analyses, you will be able to see how many segments and words were corrected and how many characters were added by the proofreader.</p>
