<p>A wide range of input methods can be used for inserting Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters. These range from official to custom-made input methods.</p>
<p>The Web Editor supports the following input methods:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese OS Default</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese Sogou</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Japanese OS Default</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Korean 2-beolsik</li>
</ul>
<p>We have substantially restructured the support Memsource provides for CJK Input Method Editors (IMEs). We've also tested the majority of default IMEs provided by operating systems, including popular third-party IMEs, such as Sogou. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Other input methods may not be fully supported. Before reporting any problems with CJK in the Web Editor, please make sure you are using one of the supported input methods listed above.</p>
