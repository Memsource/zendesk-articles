<p><strong>Updates Made to the "Unedited Fuzzy Match" Error</strong></p>
<p>For segments containing numbers only, the <em>Unedited Fuzzy Match </em>error will no longer be displayed during the QA check.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Contentful (Entry-level) Connector Now Available</strong></p>
<p>Since there are multiple ways to localize content using Contentful, we now have a connector available to use for entry-level content in <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026241531" target="_self">Contentful</a>. Previously, there was only a connector available for field-level content.</p>

<h2 id="New_Features_and_Improvements">Fixed Bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Due to a bug, relevancy data would sometimes not be displayed on the <em>Edit </em>page for Linguist users. This has now been resolved.</li>
<li>When creating a project from a <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003483952-Project-Template" target="_self">template</a>, some of the parameters would occasionally be missing. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>When adding reference files to a project created with the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003461331" target="_self">Automation Widget</a>, an email would sometimes be sent to the Submitter saying that the files were unsupported. This email is no longer sent out when the files are supported.</li>
</ul>
