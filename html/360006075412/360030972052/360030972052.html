<p>Memsource supports the translation of plural-sensitive segments. These are segments which include a number. For example, an online store might have a notification saying “There are 6 items left”. However, in these kinds of segments, the number may change. If the number of items went down from 6 to 1, the word “items” would no longer be plural. Memsource supports the translation of these segments through the use of Plural Forms. Currently, this feature only supports <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Contexts.html">.po files</a></p>
<p>Once apluralized string is imported into Memsource, it is shown in all its forms in separate segments. Linguists will be able to see the required plural form for the active segment by looking at the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003462131-Context-Information-in-Memsource-Editors#Context_Note" target="_self">Context Note</a> at the bottom of the Memsource Editor where the Plural Category and the Plural Example are specified. For an example of how these will be displayed, please see the screenshot in the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030972052#Plural_Forms_in_the_Editor" target="_self">Plural Forms in the Memsource Editor</a> section below.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Currently, the feature is only supported for .po files.</p>
<h2>Plural Forms Set Up</h2>
<p>To use plural forms, your .po file will need to have a formula for plural forms in the file header. You should make sure that the formula is there, otherwise, Memsource will generate it automatically based on the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/27/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html" target="_self">Unicode CLDR standard.</a></p>
<p>When setting up your files, you should use the <em>Segment Key</em> as the context type in the <em>File Import Settings</em>. It’s also important to note that only cardinal numbers are supported.</p>
<h2>Plural Forms in the Memsource Editor</h2>
<p>When a Linguist or Vendor selects a segment that contains a plural form, the Context Note at the bottom of the Memsource Editor will always open. The Context Note in the Tools dropdown menu will be greyed out with no option to turn it on/off. The shortcut for opening/closing the Context Note in the Tools dropdown menu will also be deactivated when a segment with a plural form is selected. </p>
<p>The language locale and the plural category will be shown as part of the context for plural segments. (See the sections highlighted in blue in the screenshot below.) If you use the <em>msgctxt</em> line in your file, the context string will become part of the context, as the sections highlighted in red in the screenshot show.</p>
