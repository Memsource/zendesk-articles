<p>Gengo is a human translation integration, meaning that when you use it, you are sending individual segments to a Linguist for translation. Unfortunately, Gengo is currently not able to handle repetitions. This means that when there's a repeated segment, it will be translated several times, and if the job is divided among more than one Linguist, you can get different translations for the same source.<br> You can lock the repeated segments and exclude them from Gengo Human Translation by following the steps below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the job in Memsource Editor.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click the small arrow next to <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003633071-Segment-Sorting-and-Filters">the Filter</a>. Click <strong>Sort</strong> and choose <strong>Most Repetitions.</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>With your mouse, select all the repetitions. (Repetitions are marked with two blue arrows.) Click on the number of the first segment and scroll down to the last repetition. Press <em>Shift+click</em> on the number of the last repeated segment. This will highlight all segments.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Press <em>Ctrl+L</em> to lock all repeated segments.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> In order to have the first instance repetition sent to Gengo, click <strong>Filter, </strong> select <strong>Segment Status </strong>and then click on 1<strong>st Repetition.</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Step 6: </strong>Select all segments by pressing <em>Ctrl+Shift+A.</em></p>
<p><strong>Step 7: </strong>Unlock them by pressing <em>Ctrl+L.</em></p>
<p>Now, only the unique segments will be sent to Gengo Human Translation. After the translation is done, you will have to manually propagate the translation to the repeated segments:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the job in Memsource Editor.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select all segments and unlock them.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Filter only the 1st repetitions.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Select them all and Unconfirm them (by pressing <em>Ctrl+Shift+Enter</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> You will now have to go one by one and confirm each segment again. Once you've done this, the translation from Gengo will be propagated to all repeated segments and confirmed.</p>
