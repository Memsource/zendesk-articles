<h2>Why is Microsoft with Feedback Being Deprecated? </h2>
<p>This MT engine was free (with some limitations) to Memsource users thanks to a partnership between Memsource and Microsoft. In exchange for the free usage, Memsource would send back the post-edited translation (the “feedback”) to Microsoft. This did not include any user data. However, this feature was not fully GDPR compliant and so the feedback feature had to be discontinued with the arrival of GDPR.</p>
<p>Because of this, we have had to deprecate Microsoft with Feedback. This happened on September 3, 2018. If you currently use Microsoft with Feedback, you have been automatically migrated to the Microsoft Translator MT engine in Memsource. </p>
<p>Because of our new enhanced MT management in Memsource, you will not have to set up a Microsoft Translator account, and you can pay for your Microsoft Translator characters directly through Memsource.</p>

<p><strong>Are there any additional advantages that come with Microsoft Translator compared to Microsoft with Feedback? </strong></p>
<p>Yes, you will be able to batch <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002841231-Pre-translate-jobs">pre-translate</a> entire jobs at once, not just segment by segment during translation, which was a limitation of Microsoft with Feedback.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Is purchasing MT characters through Memsource the only option I have? </strong></p>
<p>We think it’s the most convenient option. However, you can also create a separate account with Microsoft, buy your characters there, and link the Microsoft and Memsource account via your API token.</p>
<p>To do this, you will need to deselect the <strong>Get free characters</strong> checkbox in the settings for that machine translation engine. You can access the settings by selecting the checkbox next to the MT engine and clicking <strong>Edit</strong>. You will need to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/translator/business/trial/#get-started">set up an account with Microsoft and obtain an Azure Key</a> to complete the set up. (Ignore the<em> Develop your own app</em> heading.)</p>
