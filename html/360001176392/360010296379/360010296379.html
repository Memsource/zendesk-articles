<p><strong>Importing Columns from Microsoft Excel</strong></p>
<p>It is now possible for users to select which columns they would like to import from Excel files without having to import the entire file. This can be done by using a list of columns separated by commas (e.g. A, B, F, G). These columns will be imported from every sheet in the document.</p>
