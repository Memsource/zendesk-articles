<p>As of 1 September 2019, the support email address is no longer active. It won’t be possible to contact the Technical Support team via this email address.</p>
<p><strong> Will this change the type of support I get?</strong></p>
<p>Don’t worry—you’ll still have access to our Technical Support team. We’re only making this change so you can receive the best and most efficient support possible. When a request is made through the Help Form or the Help Widget, it automatically provides us with much of the information we need about the issue you are facing.</p>
<p>This means that we are less likely to require additional information to address it. We will be able to start working to find solutions faster, providing you with a better service and saving you time and effort.</p>
