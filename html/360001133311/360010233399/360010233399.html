<p><strong>Two New QA Rules </strong></p>
<p>In order to give users more flexibility, the <em>TranslationLength </em>QA rule is now being replaced by two new rules: <em>Exceeds max length (chars) </em>and <em>Exceeds max length (as % of source)</em>. The <em>Exceeds max length (chars) </em>rule will set a maximum number of characters for a segment, and the <em>Exceeds max length (as % of source) </em>rule will ensure that the length of a translated segment is close to the length of the source segment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Punctuation is No Longer Included in Wordcounts</strong></p>
<p>Wordcounts in Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Thai documents will no longer have punctuation marks included. This will apply to general punctuation (U+2000 - U+206F), supplemental punctuation (U+2E00 - U+2E7F), and to CJK symbols and punctuation (U+3000 - U+301F only).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Changing the Color of Hidden Characters</strong></p>
<p>It is now possible for users to change the color of hidden characters. This has been done to help users distinguish between shown and hidden characters more easily.</p>

<h2 id="New_Features_and_Improvements">Fixed Bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Due to a bug, links displayed in the In-context Preview would navigate to websites instead of the appropriate segment in the translation table. This has been resolved, and users should once again use Ctrl+Click to open links.</li>
</ul>
