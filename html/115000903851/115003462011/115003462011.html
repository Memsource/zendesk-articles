<ul>
<li>
<strong>Keyboard Shortcuts</strong><br>See the list of our <a href="http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Keyboard_Shortcuts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keyboard Shortcuts</a> for both Memsource Editors. To confirm all segments, press <em>Select All (Ctrl+Shift+A)</em> and then <em>Confirm (Ctrl+Enter)</em>. <br> </li>
<li>
<strong>Selecting Words and Segments with the Mouse</strong><br>An easy and fast way to select text is to click twice on a word to select it and click three times within a segment to select the whole segment. <br> </li>
<li>
<strong>Sort /Filter Segments</strong><br>Segments can be filtered and sorted based on their content including <em>Segment Status</em> (empty, edited, locked, etc),<em> Pretranslated From </em>(101%, 100%, Fuzzy, TM, etc)<em>, or Created By / Modified By / Show Changes </em>(segments created/modified by, comments created/modified by, etc). See more details about the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003642892-Segment-Filter-and-Sorting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Desktop Filter</a> and <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003633071-Segment-Filter-and-Sorting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Web Editor Filter</a>.<br> </li>
<li>
<strong>Insert New TB Terms from the Source and Target</strong><br>Select the term in the source segment and press <em>Alt+T.</em> The selected word will be pasted into the <em>Source term </em>section at the bottom of the screen. Select the translated term in the target and press <em>Alt+T</em> again. The translation will then be pasted into the target term. Hit Enter to save it. <strong>For Mac users:</strong> use the CMD key instead of Alt.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>View Original and Preview Translation</strong><br>The View Original and Preview Translation functions in the Memsource Editor will show you the original document or generate the translation in the format of the original (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, HTML, XML, etc). You need to have the correct application installed on your computer in order to be able to open and view the document.<br>For some file types, Memsource Editor supports real-time <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003484932-In-Context-Preview">In-Context Preview</a>.<br> </li>
<li>
<strong>Differences in Fuzzy Matches</strong><br>The difference between a segment in a job and its fuzzy match (less than 100%) in the TM is displayed in the <em>CAT</em> Pane after you click on the fuzzy match—see an <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ldqv0da039vwl02/Diff.png?raw=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">image</a> of this here.<br> </li>
<li>
<strong>Re-confirming Already Confirmed Segments</strong><br>If you confirm a segment that's already been confirmed, nothing will happen. If you want to confirm the segment again (for example, to save it to a TM that you assigned later), you can either un-confirm the segment (<em>Ctrl+Shift+Enter</em> in Desktop only) and re-confirm it, or edit the segment and confirm it again.<br> </li>
<li>
<strong>Concordance Search</strong><br>Concordance searching allows you to search within the translation memory and the term base. You can either switch the right side panel from <em>CAT </em>to <em>Search </em>and enter the search text or you can select the word(s) you want to search in the source or target segment and press <em>Ctrl+K</em>. The results will then be displayed in the Search panel.<br> </li>

<strong>How to Deactivate Machine Translation</strong><br>Machine translation (MT) options are set up in the project by the Project Manager. You can choose not to have MT inserted into the target text after you confirm a segment. To do this, go to <strong>Tools, </strong>select <strong><a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003642752-Preferences">Preferences</a></strong> and deselect <em>Insert MT</em>.

<li class="topictitle closed">
<strong>Edit Terms<br></strong>If you click on a term in the <em>CAT</em> Pane, you will see <strong>Edit Source Term / Edit Target Term</strong>. Clicking on either <strong>Source Term </strong>or <strong>Target Term </strong>will let you edit that term. If this option is not visible, then the term is not yours and you will not be able to edit it.<br>As a Linguist user, you will by default be able to edit only your own terms. However, you can be allowed by your Project Manager to edit other users' terms as well.<br><img src="https://help.memsource.com/hc/article_attachments/360020623672/mceclip0.png" width="424" height="381">
