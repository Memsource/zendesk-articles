<p> </p>
<p>Select <strong>Authentication </strong>on the right side of the screen and then select the <strong>API Keys </strong>tab. Under the <em>Docs API </em>section, click <strong>Generate an API Key. </strong>Copy this key and save it somewhere.</p>
<h2>Set up the Connector in Memsource</h2>
<p>In Memsource, navigate to Setup and scroll down to the <em>Integrations </em>section. Click on <strong>Connectors.</strong> After clicking on <strong>New</strong>, you can choose the connector you wish to create. Give it a name, change the Type to <em>Help Scout, </em>and paste your API key into the <em>Help Scout Docs API key </em>field<em>.</em></p>
<p>In the <em>Help Scout Target Collection </em>field, type the name of an existing Help Scout collection, or the name of the new collection you want to create. If you create a new collection, this new collection will also appear in the list of collections in your Help Scout account.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> To view a Help Scout collection created via the connector in Memsource, the collection must first be saved. Do this by navigating to Help Scout, clicking on <strong>Manage, </strong>and selecting <strong>Docs. </strong>Then, select the target site for the collection. Note that in a Basic or Standard account, there will only be one site. In a Plus account, there will be multiple sites. Select <strong>Collections </strong>on the left-hand side and click on the collection created by the connector. Finally, click <strong>Save Collection.</strong></p>

<p>Once these fields are completed, click <strong>Test connection.</strong></p>
<p>For a Basic or Standard Help Scout account, a message will appear to confirm the connection to the single site on Help Scout.</p>
<p>For a Plus Help Scout account, a list of your multilingual sites will be displayed. Select the language of each site from the drop-down lists. You will also need to select which site will be the source site for the translation.</p>

<h2>Translate Articles from Help Scout</h2>
<p>Please note that when an article is first translated and exported back to Help Scout, the article will appear as a draft and will need to be published manually. However, if an article already published in Help Scout is translated in Memsource, once it is exported back into Help Scout the article will immediately be published.</p>
