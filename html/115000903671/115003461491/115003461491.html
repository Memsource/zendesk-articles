<p>The bilingual DOCX file feature converts an MXLIFF file into a DOCX file and back. This is typically used to make edits before re-importing the file back to Memsource. It is not recommended for translation.<br> <br> <strong>In the DOCX format you can:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Run a spellcheck in MS Word rather than in Memsource Editor.</li>
<li>Pass a bilingual DOCX file to a customer or another user who prefers working in Word (as an "unclean document").</li>
</ul>
<p><br> <strong>Please note that:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The text is exported in a wide and long table and is <strong>not suitable for printing.</strong>
</li>
<li>Translations for repetitions <strong>are not displayed</strong> in the bilingual DOCX file. Only the translation for the 1st instance of a repetition is displayed. Please take note of the instruction at the top of the bilingual DOCX file: "When a segment gets repeated, the font is light grey, and you do NOT have to translate it."</li>
<li>Tags are <strong>not protected.</strong>
</li>
<li>In <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022358991-Bidirectional-Text" target="_self">RTL languages</a> (Arabic, Hebrew), tags such as {2&gt; will be inverted to &lt;2{  In order to get correct tags in Memsource, the tags in RTL Word must be &lt;2{ word }2&gt;</li>
<li>The resources (TM, TB, machine translation) are<strong> not available</strong> for bilingual DOCX files.</li>
<li>Segments cannot be sorted or filtered.</li>
<li>Segments cannot be confirmed (They can only be uploaded and then confirmed in Memsource Editor).</li>
<li>Comments are <strong>read-only.</strong> Changes to them will not be imported back into Memsource.</li>
</ul>
<p><br> <strong>The bilingual DOCX file can be generated in two ways:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>From Memsource Editor by clicking on <strong>Document</strong> and selecting <strong>Export to Bilingual DOCX</strong>
</li>
<li>From a Memsource project by clicking on <strong>Document</strong> and selecting <strong>-DOCX</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p><br> <strong>It can be uploaded back into Memsource again in two ways:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>From Memsource Editor by clicking on <strong>Document</strong> and selecting <strong>Import from Bilingual DOCX</strong>
</li>
<li>From a Memsource project by clicking on <strong>Tools</strong> and selecting <strong>Upload... </strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In both cases, you can choose whether to save segments from the bilingual DOCX into your <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003692212-Translation-Memories" target="_self">translation memory</a> or not.<br> <br> <br>The Bilingual DOCX can also be re-formatted into a <strong>Trados unclean DOCX</strong> using Word macros from third-party <a href="http://blog.zappmedia.net/2012/07/a-plus-for-translator-productivity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlusToyz</a>.<br> <br> <strong>Important: </strong>Uploading part of a Bilingual DOCX is not directly supported, but there is a workaround: In the Bilingual DOCX, you can delete the lines that you don't want to have uploaded. If you do this, make sure that you keep the table header at the beginning of the file. Then the Bilingual DOCX can then be uploaded, either through the Editor or directly on the Web.</p>
