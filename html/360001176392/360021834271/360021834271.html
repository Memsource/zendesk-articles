<h2>Fixed Bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Multiple &lt;mrk&gt; tags in XLIFF files will no longer be removed when downloading the completed file, therefore preserving the structure of the original XLIFF document.</li>
<li>When exported, RTL text was sometimes incorrectly aligned (to the left). This issue has now been fixed.</li>
<li>The HTML entities <strong>&amp;sup1; </strong>and <strong>&amp;sup2;</strong> were not correctly recognized when imported. This has now been resolved.</li>
<li>When downloading multiple files in the XLIFF format, the exported ZIP file sometimes did not contain all the selected files. This bug has now been fixed.</li>
<li>The In-context Preview was sometimes missing for some target languages when processing multilingual Excel files. This has now been fixed.</li>
<li>Projects created from a Project Template sometimes did not contain all attached reference files from the template. This bug is now fixed.</li>
<li>When translating YAML files, some numbers were not correctly exported to the target document. This has now been fixed.</li>
<li>If the <strong>Notify linguist</strong> option was used during job creation and the selected email template contained the wordcount macro, the resulting email incorrectly contained a negative wordcount. This bug is now fixed.</li>
<li>Due to a bug, some accounts may have not been properly extended after issuing the payment correctly. This has now been resolved.</li>
<li>Job Board postings were temporarily inaccessible; this was fixed shortly after the issue had been discovered. </li>
</ul>
