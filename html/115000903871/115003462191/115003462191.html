<p>Google Sign-up allows users to register for Memsource with their Google accounts. However, this sign-up effectively bypasses the use of standard credentials (username/password) in Memsource. It is therefore not possible to use the same credentials in the Memsource Editor for your desktop. The steps to use Memsource Editor for your desktop in these accounts are outlined below.<br>  </p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Log into your Memsource account using the <strong>Sign in with Google</strong> option.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Go to <strong>Users </strong>and find the username that's set to your Google address (e.g. <em>john.doe@gmail.com</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Open the user's profile and click on <strong>Edit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> In the <em>Password </em>section, type your desired password. This password does not need to be the same as your Google password; using different passwords will not prevent you from using the Sign in with Google feature.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Use the email address (your username) and the newly saved password in the Memsource Editor for your desktop.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> The connection will now be established and you can start your work in the Memsource Editor.</p>
