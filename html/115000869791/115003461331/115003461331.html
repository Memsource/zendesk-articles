<p>The Automation Widget makes it extremely easy (but, thanks to  HTTPS, secure) to embed a <em>"Submit files"</em> functionality into a website or to use with your local intranet. Clients will be able to upload their files, get a quote, and confirm their order. The files are then automatically uploaded to a new project in Memsource and are ready for translation. When the translation is completed, the client can download the translated file using the provided link.

<div> </div>
<div>A Translation agency wants to have a widget on their web page so that any potential customer can upload their files for translation, instantly get a quote, and confirm the order. The agency offers translations from English, German, and French to Czech and Slovak. In order to set this widget up, the agency will take the following steps:</div>
<div> </div>
<ol>
<li>In <strong>Setup,</strong> scroll down to the <em>Financials </em>section and click on<strong> </strong><strong>Price List.</strong> Click <strong>New</strong> to create a new Price List. Save it with the name "General Price List". This will allow the company to<strong>:</strong>
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>In <strong>Setup,</strong> go to the <em>Automation </em>section and click on<strong> Services.</strong> Click <strong>New</strong> to create a new service. Name it "General Service". This will let the company:

</li>
<li>Select the "General Price List" from step one to use as the <em>Price List</em>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
