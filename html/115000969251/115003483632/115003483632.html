Some user are not able to open translated documents (Completed or translation preview) in Word 2007.<br>
This is due the compatibility issues of Microsoft Word 2007 (know for its bugs and compatibility problems).<br>
<br>
The best solution would be to upgrade the 10 years old software to newer version.<br>
The other option is to download and install <strong>free </strong>Libre Office, open the docx downloaded from Memsource and save it as doc. This file then will work in Word 2007.<br>
<br>
Libre Office can be downloaded <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/" target="_blank">here</a>.
