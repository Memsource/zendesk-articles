<h2>HubSpot Connector Use Cases</h2>
<p>There are a number of use cases for the connector:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li>Project Managers can <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003483992" target="_self">add files directly to projects from an online repository</a>. Only documents that match the connector's source language or don't have any language set are listed.</li>
<li>Set up the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003941812" target="_self">Automation Widget</a> allowing Submitters to add files to requests directly from the online repository. Only documents that match the connector's source language or don't have any language set are listed.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003460931" target="_self">Automated Project Creation</a> to have Memsource automatically create new projects when a change in the <strong>last modified date</strong> is detected in monitored files or a folder.<br>
<ul>
<li>Selected files are imported the very first time APC runs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <a href="https://cloud.memsource.com/web/docs/api#tag/Connector" target="_self">Connector API</a> can be used to automate steps otherwise performed manually through the UI. <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004209771" target="_self">Webhooks</a> can be used to have Memsource notify 3rd party systems about certain events (for example, a job status change).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<em>as multi-language groups</em> - the translated pages are linked to the master page and form a language group. This option is supported by HubSpot for only Landing and Website pages. For more information, see <a href="https://knowledge.hubspot.com/cos-general/how-to-manage-multi-language-content-with-hubspots-cos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manage multi-language</a> (HubSpot link).</li>
<li>
<em>as separate documents</em> - the translated pages are stored as siblings. Language code appended to their internal page name differentiates the individual translations (e.g., Homepage vs. Homepage [de]).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set the <strong>Source Language</strong>
<ul>
<li>This language must match the <strong>Source language</strong> of the Memsource project and should match the <strong>Primary language</strong> of the HubSpot site that's configured in HubSpot <em>Domains &amp; URLs</em> settings.</li>
