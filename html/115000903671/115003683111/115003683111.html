<p>The Project Archives are available for the Team, Ultimate, and Enterprise editions and can be found in <strong>Setup </strong>under the <em>Tools </em>section.</p>
<p>Here, you can mark one or more projects (including filtered views) and <strong>Archive</strong> them. Such projects can no longer be accessed and can only be viewed here. However, by using the <strong>Restore</strong> button in the Archive itself, projects can be restored back into the list of projects and accessed again.</p>
<p>Archived projects are subject to the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003843132-Data-Storage">Data Storage</a> policy and will be deleted accordingly.</p>
