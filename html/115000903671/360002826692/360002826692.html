<p>When downloading multiple original or completed files at once, they will be automatically zipped. In multilingual projects, the ZIP will have a special language structure: one folder for each target language.</p>
<p>For best results, we recommend extracting zip files with WinZip, WinRAR, or Total Commander. With the Windows internal zip utility, file names sometimes become garbled after being extracted.</p>
