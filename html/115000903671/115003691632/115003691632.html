<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Sharing in Memsource primarily means sharing resources between separate organizations in Memsource. One organization creates a project and then shares the whole project or just some selected jobs with another organization.</p>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p>In Memsource, a sharing is a connecting two cooperating organizations: a "Buyer" and a "Vendor". These are not fixed roles, and only determine the relationship. This means that for some projects, an organization can act as a Buyer, while for others it can act as a Vendor.</p>
<p>Sharing is available in all of our paid editions.</p>
<h3>Buyer</h3>
<p>A Buyer is an organization with an account in Memsource that can assign projects to other organizations (vendors) in Memsource.</p>
<p>Organizations with the following editions can act as buyers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Team</li>
<li>Ultimate</li>
<li>Enterprise</li>
</ul>
<h3>Vendor</h3>
<p>A Vendor is an organization that can be assigned projects or jobs by other organizations (Buyers).</p>
<p>Organizations with the following editions can act as vendors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Team Start</li>
<li>Team</li>
<li>Ultimate</li>
<li>Enterprise</li>
</ul>
<h3>Vendor Connection</h3>
<p>A Buyer needs to establish the Vendor connection before sharing projects or jobs with them. The Vendor organization needs to provide its <em>Vendor Token</em> to the Buyer in order to set it up.</p>
<p>The Vendor Token is located at the top of the Vendor organization's <strong>Setup</strong> page in the <em>Organization </em>section of Memsource.<img class="img350" title="Vendor token" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/7cs29xnkzymgq49/setup_VendorToken.png?raw=1"></p>
<p>After receiving the token from the vendor, the buyer organization can go ahead and add the new vendor to their vendor list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <strong>Setup</strong> and click on <strong>Vendors</strong> in the <em>Administration section</em>. Then, click <strong>New</strong>.</li>
<li>Enter the Vendor token</li>
<li>You can also add a net rate scheme and price list (if applicable)</li>
<li>You can also set the Relevancy of this vendor (the Vendor will be offered as "Relevant" in the Providers list when sharing a project or jobs): source and target languages, clients, domains, subdomains, and Workflow.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sharing</h2>
<p>Once the connection between Buyer and Vendor is established and your project and jobs are prepared, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030023911" target="_self">Share the Project</a> with Vendor or Buyer</li>
<li>
<a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029685912" target="_self">Share the jobs</a> with one or multiple Vendors</li>
</ul>
