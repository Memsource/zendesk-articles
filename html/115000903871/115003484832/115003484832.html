<p>In order for a Linguist to set a job to Complete, every segment in that job has to be confirmed (unless locked by the Project Manager). Here are few tips about confirming segments in Memsource Editor:</p>
<ul>
<li>A segment can be confirmed by either clicking on the <strong>Confirm</strong> button in the <strong>Edit </strong>menu or by using the shortcut keys <em>Ctrl+Enter</em>.<br> <br> <img style="width: 500px; height: 93px;" src="https://help.memsource.com/hc/article_attachments/115004107651/import-755333.jpg" alt="">
</li>
<li>Multiple segments can be selected at once. To do this, select the row number of a segment, press <em>Ctrl,</em> and click on the other rows you want to select. You can then confirm them in a batch via <em>Ctrl+Enter</em> as noted above.</li>
<li>To select multiple rows together (rows 1—10, for example) click on the first row you want to select. Then press <em>Shift</em> and select the last row in your range.</li>
<li>All segments in a job can be selected at once (by pressing <em>Ctrl+Shift+A)</em> and confirmed in a batch. Please note that selecting and confirming all segments in a large job might take a moment in the Web Editor.</li>
<li>Confirmed or unconfirmed segments can also be <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003642892-Segment-Filter-and-Sorting">filtered</a>, selected (by clicking on one of the segments and pressing <em>Ctrl+Shift+A</em>), and confirmed or unconfirmed in a batch.<br><br> <img src="https://relianta.sirv.com/Desktop%20Editor/TE%20confirming%20segments%20-%20filter%20not%20confirmed.jpg?format=png&amp;scale.width=800" alt="" width="800" height="228">
</li>
<li>A segment can be set to unconfirmed by editing its target content, by selecting <strong>Unc</strong><strong>onfirm Segment </strong>from the <strong>Edit </strong>menu, or with the shortcut <em>Ctrl+Shift+Enter</em>.<br> Note that Linguist can always come back to the confirmed segments, edit the translation (segment will be automatically unconfirmed) and then confirm again.</li>
<li>Linguists can (and always should) run a QA check. This will warn them about possible issues, including unconfirmed segments.<br> <br><img src="https://help.memsource.com/hc/article_attachments/360021191671/mceclip2.png"><br> <br>  </li>
<li>Linguists can decide what should happen after the segment is confirmed by going to <strong>Tools </strong>and clicking <strong>Preferences </strong>(e.g. if the <em>Next unconfirmed segment </em>is selected, the cursor will automatically jump to the next unconfirmed segment after confirming a segment). <br><img src="https://help.memsource.com/hc/article_attachments/360021249692/mceclip1.png"><br>  </li>
