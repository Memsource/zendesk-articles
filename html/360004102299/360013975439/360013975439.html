<p>Support tickets are categorized according to the severity with the designations <span class="bold bold"><strong>P1</strong></span>/<span class="bold bold"><strong>P2</strong></span>/<span class="bold bold"><strong>P3</strong></span>/<span class="bold bold"><strong>P4</strong></span>. These designations provide guidance and are used by the support team to process tickets according to the assigned priority.</p>
<p>Only <span class="bold bold"><strong>P1</strong></span> severity requests that require an immediate response or direct help from Memsource Technical Support Agents may be processed out of turn.</p>
<p>When submitting a ticket, supply detailed information so the Memsource Technical Support Team can properly identify and diagnose the issue. This speeds up the response times and facilitates the resolution of the ticket. Failure to provide this information results in support delays.</p>
<p>Ticket resolution time cannot be guaranteed for a number of reasons including, but not limited to:</p>

<p>Memsource as a whole or one of its components mentioned on the Status Page is not available and your productivity has been halted. This also includes situations in which your custom integration with Memsource is broken and you start experiencing severe performance issues. This issue usually affects the majority of Memsource users and as such, it is reported by other users as well. For treating a ticket as P1-BLOCKER by Memsource Technical Support Team, the single distinguishing criterion is if this problem is going to be, or already is reported on the Status Page. The support agents will provide regular 30-60 minutes on the SP and inform the ticket submitter directly in the ticket when the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>If the ticket submitter abuses the P1-BLOCKER severity level to report a non-P1 issue, the severity of the ticket will be immediately downgraded by the Memsource Support Agent.</p>
