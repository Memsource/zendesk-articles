<p>Users of Ultimate and Enterprise<strong> </strong>editions of Memsource can now white label the email address that is used to send notifications from their Memsource account (as opposed to the current, generally used address <em>system@memsource.com</em>).</p>
<p>To set up your Custom Email, please follow the steps below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Contact <a href="mailto:support@memsource.com">support@memsource.com</a> and provide the domain and subdomain you wish to use (e.g. Domain: abctranslations.com, Subdomain: email). Please note that the desired combination of subdomain and domain may already be taken, and you may thus be required to suggest a replacement.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Memsource Support will configure the Custom Email on our side and provide you with DNS Records that you will need to validate (please consult with the provider of your domain if necessary).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Contact Memsource Support once this update of DNS records takes place, so we can validate the configuration and activate the custom email.</p>
