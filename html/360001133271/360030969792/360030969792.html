<p><strong>Pluralized Segments Now Supported</strong></p>
<p>Memsource now supports the translation of <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360031122932" target="_self">plural-sensitive segments</a> when working with <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Contexts.html" target="_self">.po files</a>. Once plural segments are imported into Memsource, all of the plural forms will be shown to the users in separate segments. Users will be able to see which plural form is required by looking in the <em>Context Note. </em>This will show both the Plural Category and the Plural Example for this segment.</p>

<h2 id="New_Features_and_Improvements">Fixed Bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>When using a Mac, switching between the <em>More, QA, Changes, </em>and <em>CAT </em>Panes using Ctrl + Tab would not always work. This has now been fixed.  </li>
<li>Previously, there was a QA error called <em>Trailing spaces</em>. Since there is already a <em>Leading/Trailing spaces </em>error, the <em>Trailing spaces </em>error has been removed.</li>
</ul>
