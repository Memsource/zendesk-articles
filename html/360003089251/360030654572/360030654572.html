<p>Version 3 of the mobile app includes a major new feature—Memsource Editor for Mobile, a tool only available in the Memsource Mobile app.</p>
<p>Now, with Memsource Mobile, not only can you manage and accept jobs on the go, but you can also translate on the move. Both PMs and Linguists can carry out segment-by-segment translations or reviews, using all the <em>CAT</em> Pane translation resources they normally would, including matches from term bases and translation memories and machine translation suggestions, all from within the app.</p>
