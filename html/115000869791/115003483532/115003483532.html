<p>In general, the best practice is to <em>not</em>Â pre-translate a file in advance. It is better to use the default behavior of Memsource Editor, which will always pre-translate the next segment you jump to (after confirming the previous segment).</p>
<p>This ensures that you get the best match available at that moment. If you pre-translate the whole file in Memsource in advance, it is possible that you could lose some matches that are created between the moment of batch pre-translation and the actual moment when the translator arrives at that segment (e.g. translated by someone else or even translated by the same translator earlier on in the file).</p>
<p>Sometimes it is, of course, useful to pre-translate in advance. An example of this would be when you want to work offline, or when you want to pre-translate just 101% matches. These, however, are less common cases.</p>
