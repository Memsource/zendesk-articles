<p>Microsoft SharePoint Online is a file hosting, cloud-based service that lets you easily store your documents. Below, you’ll find instructions on how to integrate your SharePoint account with Memsource.</p>
<h2>Set up the Connector</h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You will need to have pop-ups enabled in your browser.</p>
<p>Before setting up the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003948452-Connectors">connector</a> in Memsource, you'll want to log in to your SharePoint account. If you are logged into SharePoint, Memsource will be able to get your SharePoint information during the setup process.</p>
<p>Navigate to Setup and scroll down to the <em>Integrations </em>section. Click on <strong>Connectors.</strong> After clicking on <strong>New</strong>, you can choose the connector you wish to create. Give it a name and change the Type to <em>Microsoft SharePoint.</em></p>

<p>Next, you’ll enter the URL for your SharePoint account into the <em>SharePoint site</em> <em>URL</em> field. This will be everything up to and including the “.com” in your URL. For example: <em>https://memsource086.sharepoint.com/</em></p>
<p>Finally, click <strong>Connect to SharePoint. </strong>You'll see a popup window that will ask for your SharePoint credentials. If you are already logged into SharePoint, this information will be filled in automatically and the window will close. If you haven't logged into SharePoint, you'll have to enter this information manually and then close the window yourself. </p>
<p>If you’ve entered everything correctly, you’ll see a little check mark appear next to the <strong>Connect to SharePoint </strong>button. Then, click <strong>Save.</strong></p>
