<p>With "Assign Providers from a Template" feature in the Project &gt; Tools, a Project Manager can assign providers (Linguists or Vendors) to each of the project workflow steps using a pre-existing <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003680771-Projects#Project_Templates_1">Project Template</a></p>

<p>It is possible to assign providers in different ways:</p>
<p>a) <strong>Assign all providers to all jobs at once</strong> - don’t select any jobs and navigate to the Assign Providers from a Template option in the <strong>Tools</strong> menu.</p>
<p>b) <strong>Assign some providers to some jobs across all workflows</strong> - don’t select any jobs and navigate to the Assign Providers from a Template option in the <strong>Tools</strong> menu.</p>
<p>c) <strong>Assign providers to selected jobs only</strong> - select the jobs first and then navigate to the Assign Providers from a Template option in the <strong>Tools</strong> menu.</p>
<p><strong>Additional information</strong>: Assigning providers from a template won’t overwrite any existing assignments. You can assign providers from multiple templates as long as the templates match the criteria.</p>
<p>Once the Assign Providers from a Template option is selected, a pop-up appears with a drop-down list of Project Templates. Select the appropriate template.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the number of workflow steps and the source language in your chosen project template must match those in your new project, if not the project template will not appear in the list.  The target languages can be different, but at least one of the target languages must be the same. If anything needs to be changed in a template it can be edited by selecting <strong>Project Template </strong>from the main settings and clicking on the required template. The <strong>Edit Project Template</strong> page will open.</p>
