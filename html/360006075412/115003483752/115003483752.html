<p>Memsource users are able to visualize data from their accounts through Kibana, an open-source data visualization workbench. Kibana allows you to visualize and explore all data indexed by our analytics data warehouse, and there is an almost endless number of queries that can be visualized using Kibana.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Each organization only has access to the subset of its own data.</p>
<h2>Sample Visualizations</h2>
<p>These are some of the queries that can be built and visualized using Kibana:</p>
<ul>
<li>Projects/jobs by the Project Manager</li>
<li>Projects by the machine translation engine used</li>
<li>Jobs by the Linguist/Vendor, including overdue jobs</li>
<li>Jobs by file type</li>
<li>Top language pairs, etc.</li>
</ul>
