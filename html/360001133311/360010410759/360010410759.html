<h2>Fixed Bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>In IE, a word selected from source/target to be used for a filter was not copied for use in the filter. Selected word is now copied for use in the filter.</li>
<li>A segment highlighted for use in a filter would lose the highlight when filtered. Highlight is now maintained in the filtered view.</li>
<li>Using CTRL+F8 to remove tags from a confirmed segment did not unconfirm the segment and the removal of the tags was not stored in the segment if reconfirmed. Use of CTRL+F8 now unconfirms a previously confirmed segment.</li>
<li>If content was removed from a tag within a job and saved, the tag although empty was no longer editable. Emptied tags are now editable.</li>
</ul>
