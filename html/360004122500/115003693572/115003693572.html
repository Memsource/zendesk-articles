<p>The Home Page is available for Team, Ultimate, and Enterprise editions. It provides easy access to pre-defined Analytics and selected Automation Widgets. The content of the Home Page can also be customized (dashboards and widgets can be added or removed).</p>
<p>On the Home Page, you can add and arrange dashboards according to your preferences. When you select <strong>Add Dashboard</strong> at the top of the page, you are presented with eight dashboard options: <em>Providers, Jobs, Issues, Costs, Savings, Leverage, Machine Translation, </em>and <em>Automation Widget.</em></p>
<h2>Benefits of the Analytics Dashboards</h2>
<p><strong>For Translation Agencies:</strong> Analytics Dashboards allow you to see an overview of current projects’ statuses, your team’s productivity, and the savings from Machine Translation and translation memories.</p>
<p><strong>For Translation Buyers:</strong> Analyze costs per Vendor, see a status overview of all your current projects, and generate localization ROI reports.</p>
<p><strong>Export data:</strong> Each chart can be downloaded as CSV file by clicking on the <em>Save</em> icon in the top right corner of the chart window.</p>
<h2>Dynamic Dashboards</h2>
<p>Each of the eight dashboards has a minimum of three charts with a breakdown of different features and reports. <em>Leverage</em> includes charts related to the date projects were created; savings based on the use of machine translation, translation memory, and repetitions; and savings for individual clients or Vendors.</p>
<p>The charts are dynamic and adjustable—they can be arranged and resized as desired, and users can select and deselect options like language pairings, currencies, and time to create the desired report. Links of Linguist names and projects will open a new window with additional information.</p>

<p>Available dashboards to showcase financial reporting include Cost and Savings, Leverage, and Machine Translation. </p>
