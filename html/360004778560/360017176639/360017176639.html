<p>Linguists are translators, reviewers or proofreaders and have a <a class="link" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013918760" target="_blank" rel="noopener">specified role</a> in Memsource.</p>
<p>Linguists will spend most of their time working within the <a class="link" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012775880" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Memsource Editor</a>. Although it is easy to access a job and start translating, it is highly recommended that some time is spent looking into the <a class="link" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/sections/360003807219" target="_blank" rel="noopener">features</a> of the editor before getting started.</p>
<p>The first step for linguists is to access their account. New linguist users receive an email with instructions on how to <a class="link" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360014250879" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set up a password</a>.</p>
<p>When logged in, linguists are presented with the <a class="link" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013918760-Linguist-Overview#linguist-portal-0-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linguist Portal</a> where assigned <a class="link" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013675740" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jobs</a> are managed.</p>
<p>Clicking on a job will open it in the <a class="link" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012775920" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Memsource Editor for Web</a> which is the preferred tool as all associated <a class="link" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013766279" target="_blank" rel="noopener">translation memories</a> and <a class="link" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013766299" target="_blank" rel="noopener">term bases</a> are automatically connected.</p>
<p>Jobs can also be downloaded if a linguist prefers and the project manager allows editing in the <a class="link" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012775900" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Memsource Editor for Desktop</a> where login credentials will need to be applied in order to access <a class="link" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/sections/360003999700-Translation-Resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener">translation resources</a>. Downloaded files can also be edited in an external <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_translation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CAT tool</a> but there will be no access to Memsource translation resources.</p>
<p>When a job is complete, the linguist <a class="link" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013675740-Jobs-Overview#change-job-status-0-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changes the status</a> to <span class="guimenu">Completed</span> and the jobs are no longer accessible for editing.</p>
