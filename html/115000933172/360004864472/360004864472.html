<p>Memsource offers two different translation workbenches: Memsource Editor for the web and Memsource Editor for your desktop. To use the desktop editor, you will first need to download and install it on your computer. You can download it for free from our <a href="https://www.memsource.com/download/">Downloads page</a>. There is more information about installing the desktop editor in <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003632351-Memsource-Desktop-Editor-Installation">this article</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Before you can open a job for translation, you must accept the job (see <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004921351" target="_self">Lesson 1</a>). </p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>To translate a job in the web editor, click on the name of that job. If you want to open multiple files, select the checkbox next to each job and click on the name of one of these jobs. The jobs must have the same language combination. Opening multiple jobs at once will join the files together in one editor window so you can seamlessly transition between them. </p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To view jobs using the desktop editor, click on the <strong>Download</strong> button and choose <strong>Bilingual MXLIFF</strong>. If you want to open multiple jobs, again they must have the same language combination. You can choose to join them into a single MXLIFF file or download them separately as a ZIP folder.</p>
<p><img src="https://help.memsource.com/hc/article_attachments/360022876231/mceclip0.png" width="769" height="603"></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Step 4: </strong>When you open the desktop editor for the first time, you will be prompted to fill in your Memsource username and password. If these are incorrect, you will not be able to connect to the translation resources attached to the project, such as translation memories or term bases, and your translations will not be synchronized with the server.</p>
<p>The desktop editor can, however, work independently of the Memsource platform and can be installed on Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. You also have the option to work offline and sync your work when you reconnect to the internet. The Editors are almost identical and you can switch between them at any time. </p>
<p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Start translating! In the <em>CAT</em> Pane, on the right-hand side, you will receive suggestions from the project’s resources, like translation memories or term bases. Insert a <em>CAT</em> Pane suggestion by selecting a target segment and double-clicking the suggestion. </p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Once you’ve finished working on a segment, you can confirm that it’s complete by selecting <strong>Confirm segment</strong> from the <em>Edit</em> menu or by pressing the appropriate <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003643292-Keyboard-Shortcuts">keyboard shortcut</a> <em>(Ctrl+Enter</em>). You can also click the red <strong>X </strong>in the third column. Confirmed segments are automatically saved. </p>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>The <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003484932-In-Context-Preview">In-context Preview</a> feature can be helpful, as it shows the source or target content within the layout of the original document. You can, for example, make sure that the target text fits within the original layout. This can reduce the need for further editing of text boxes, fonts, etc. once the translation is complete. </p>

<p><strong>Step 7: </strong>When the translation is complete, Memsource recommends running a <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003484052-Quality-Assurance">Quality Assurance</a> (QA) check to make sure that any issues with the translation, such as empty target segments or multiple spaces, are resolved. To run a QA check, click on the QA tab in the bottom of the <em>CAT</em> Pane (the bottom right part of your screen) and then click <strong>Run</strong> at the top of the window.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> After you have run the QA check and resolved any issues, navigate back to the <em>Project</em> page and set the status of the job to <strong>Completed</strong>. Once a job is set to Completed, you will no longer be able to access it. The project will move to the next step in the workflow and your job is done! </p>
