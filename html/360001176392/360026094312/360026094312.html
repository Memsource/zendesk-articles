<p><strong>Contentstack Connector is Now Available</strong></p>
<p>We now have a <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025513652?flash_digest=98534c1082a5cc180b7deb6dd60c663c91090169" target="_self">Contentstack Connector</a> available. Users with an Enterprise edition can now translate their websites, mobile apps, and other channels either manually or through automatic project creation. There are a few things to note when setting up the Contentstack Connector:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contentstack does not support languages without locales. Because of this, you'll need to use localized languages such as <em>French (France)</em> or <em>English (United States)</em>.</li>
<li>Due to limitations with Contentstack API auth tokens, we do not recommend creating more than one connector per stack.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Improvements Made to the Zendesk Connector</strong></p>
<p>The Zendesk Connector has been improved to allow for better language synchronization. </p>
