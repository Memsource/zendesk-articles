<p><strong>Support for Bi-directional Texts </strong></p>
<p>RTL (right-to-left) and LTR (left-to-right) marks have been introduced in Memsource Editor for the web. These marks enable translators to define the directionality of a text segment. </p>
<p>This is particularly important for texts with mixed directionality; these marks allow bi-directional texts to be translated within a segment with the correct directionality, without needing to be edited in other text editors. </p>
<p>Included with this feature is improved support for bi-directional texts in our in-context preview; when switching between source and target languages in the in-context preview, the text direction of the preview will also be switched. </p>

<p><strong>Insert Numbered Tags From a List </strong></p>
<p>Using the shortcut <em>CTRL+comma</em>, users can now select tags from a list to insert into a target segment. This new feature makes handling tags even faster and more flexible. </p>
<p>We recently added <a href="https://www.memsource.com/blog/2018/05/15/new-option-for-inserting-numbered-tags-in-editors/">a keyboard shortcut</a> to make it easier to specify the tag number and position of the tags in the target segment. The list option builds on this feature as more than 9 tags from a source segment can be shown at once. </p>
<p>The GIF below shows the new list feature in action. </p>
