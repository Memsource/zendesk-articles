<p>Dropbox is a cloud-based file storage and synchronization service designed to integrate with most operating systems and devices, sync content in real time across multiple devices, and act as a backup repository for data—i.e., if a device breaks, gets stolen, or fails, the data will still be retrievable from another device. It frees up space on local hard drives and can be used as a platform for sending or receiving files that are too big to be emailed. Real-time collaboration between users is also possible. You can manually access those folders to create translation jobs in Memsource, or you can configure<a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003460931-Automated-Project-Creation"> Automated Project Creation</a> to initiate jobs based on rules that you define in a<a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003483952-What-is-a-Project-Template-"> project template</a>.</p>

<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">You can create subfolders within your source folder. For example: target/{targetLang} will result in source/target/de'</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">You can also create an absolute path. To do this, begin your path with a slash (/). For example: /Output/APC-out/{targetLang} </li>
</ul>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>Sometimes, the connector can become invalid. If this happens, it’ll be shown with a red exclamation mark. This can happen for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The authorization token expires after a long period of inactivity</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Users revoke the access</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Users change their credentials for a remote service (Dropbox, Google, ...)</li>
</ul>
<p>If this happens, the Dropbox connector’s edit dialog will show a <strong>Re-authenticate </strong>button that you can use to re-establish the connection. </p>
