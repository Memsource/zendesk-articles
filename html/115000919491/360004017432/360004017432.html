<strong>Tip:</strong> You can create a new job directly from an email attachment or add a file from another app.</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are using an iOS device, you can share the file with Memsource. On an Android device, you can open the file with the Memsource app.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After you add a file, you can adjust the job settings. For example, if your project has multiple target languages, you can select which target languages are required for that job. You can then decide on the Linguists or Vendors for each of the chosen languages. The list of Linguists and Vendors that appears is based on the accounts associated with your organization’s account. Jobs can also be pre-translated based on the the project's pre-translate settings.</span></p>
<p>Jobs can be joined and opened together if they of the same language combination, of the same project, and from the same workflow step.</p>
