<h2>New Features and Improvements</h2>
<p><strong>Penalizing 101% TM Matches by 1% </strong></p>
<p>If you have multiple translation memories assigned to a project, you may want to penalize the matches of one TM over another. This alters, for example, the order of matches in the Editors’ CAT pane (see <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003461351#menu3">Setting Penalties for Translation Memories</a>). Previously, penalties were applied to a whole TM. Now, a 1% penalty can be applied to only 101% (in-context) matches within a TM. This new option can be selected from the penalties section when you attach TMs to a project. </p>
<p>This option is useful if, for example, you would like a Linguist to decide which 101% match from different TMs should be used in a translation. The penalty will mean that none of the in-context matches are inserted automatically into the target segment if the text is pre-translated. </p>

<p><strong>Improved Visualization of Project Page Sections</strong></p>
<p>You will now be able to see the number of term bases, jobs, quotes, analyses, and references on the project page when those sections are minimized.</p>
<h2>Fixed Bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">When a Vendor edits the project settings in a shared project with different MT engines for different target languages, those MT engines will no longer be deselected when the new settings are saved.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Because of some changes we made to our MT engine setup, for a while it wasn't possible to add MT engines to a project when using Microsoft Edge. This has been fixed. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Now, if you search for and export Hiragana or Katakana symbols from a translation memory via API, the segments containing those symbols will be exported. Previously, there was a bug that prevented the segments from being exported properly. Kanji symbols were unaffected by this bug.</li>
</ul>
