<div class="thumbinner">Auto-complete is available in the Memsource Editor. The auto-complete feature helps you type faster by offering you words from the right <em>CAT</em> Pane based on the characters you type. (The results come from TM segments and subsegments, MT, and the TB.)</div>

<p>If auto-complete is turned on, the list of words will be displayed automatically under the word you're typing. Press the <em>Up</em> and <em>Down</em> Arrows to select from the list. To add a selected word from the list to the target segment, press either <em>Tab</em> or <em>Enter. </em>(The first word will always be pre-selected.) Pressing the <em>Esc</em> key will hide the auto-complete window, and it will re-appear after you press any key.</p>
