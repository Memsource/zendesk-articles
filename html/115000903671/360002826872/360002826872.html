<p>The Analysis feature makes it possible to calculate the character/word count in the selected files. It also establishes the number of repetitions, non-translatables, translation memory matches, and machine translation matches. (You can do this in the <a title="Post-editing Analysis" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003942912-Post-editing-Analysis" target="_self">post-editing analysis</a> or by using <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016450971-Machine-Translation-Quality-Estimation-MTQE-">Machine Translation Quality Estimation</a>.) The Analysis can also show the number of revisions made by a reviewer. In some other CAT tools, the Analysis is referred to as a Statistic.</p>
<p>Since different billing units are used in different countries, Memsource provides the following in each analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Characters</strong> (without spaces)</li>
<li>
<strong>Words</strong> (for languages that use spaces between words—this excludes Chinese, Japanese, and Thai)</li>
<li>
<strong>Pages</strong> (1800 characters with spaces—unrelated to the actual number of pages in a file)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Creating the Analysis</h2>
<p>To run an analysis, open the project, select one or multiple jobs, and click on the <strong>Analyze</strong> button.</p>
<p><img class="img450" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/u42ngv4gtsxs6dp/Analyze-button.png?raw=1" alt="Analyze-button.png" width="579" height="173"><br><br></p>
<p>The following types of analyses are supported:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016607631" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Default</a> </strong>(before the job is translated)</li>
<li>
<strong><a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003942912" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Post-editing</a></strong> (after the job is translated)</li>
<li>
<strong><a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016608991" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compare</a></strong> (available only in projects with Workflow steps—comparing translated and reviewed jobs)<span id="Default_Analysis" class="mw-headline"></span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each Analysis can be run on multiple jobs. When doing this, it is possible to group them in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Analyze by linguist</strong>
<ul>
<li>If you have projects with many jobs assigned to various Linguists or Vendors, this option will let you do in one step what you would need to otherwise do manually with several different steps. You can use this to:
<ul>
<li>Create separate analyses containing files assigned to individual Linguists or Vendors</li>
<li>Assign these analyses to the providers in question (This will make the analyses visible to the Linguists/Vendors.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Analyze by language</strong>
<ul>
<li>If your project contains multiple target languages, you can run analyses of all files in a batch—this will create a separate analysis for each individual language. To do this, select all files, click <strong>Analysis</strong> and then select the <em>Default</em> setting. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Working with Analyses</h2>
<p>Once the Analysis is created, there are several things you can do with it.</p>
<h3>Assign the Analysis to a Provider</h3>
<p>The analysis will be available to the Provider in the <a title="Linguist Portal" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003944792-Linguist-Portal">Linguist Portal</a>. Select the analysis and click on <strong>Edit.</strong> Select the Provider (Linguist or Vendor) from the list.</p>

<h3>Apply the Net Rate Scheme</h3>
<p>You can apply a discount to words/characters/pages in an analysis. In this way, the discounted translation volume can be calculated immediately and displayed directly in the analysis in the first row called <em>Net Rate</em>. To remove the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003978132-Net-Rate-Schemes">Net Rate Scheme</a> from the analysis, simply make sure the field next to the <strong>Apply Net Rate</strong> button is left empty.<br><img class="img350" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/68lwn4izjutcgxb/analysis_netrate.png?raw=1"></p>
<h3>Customize the Analysis View</h3>
<p>You can show/hide the <em>Segments, Pages, Words, Characters,</em> and <em>Percents</em> columns in the Analysis table.</p>

<h3>Download the Analysis</h3>
<p>You can download the analysis as a CSV (with or without Characters) or LOG file format via the <strong>Download</strong> button. These files can be imported into most of the leading types of project management software.<br><img class="img350" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/eew429h5z3k7is7/analysis_download.png?raw=1" alt="analysis_download.png"></p>
