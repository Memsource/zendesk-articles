<p><strong>New Webhook for Due Date Changes</strong></p>
<p>Until now, only three webhook events were supported in Memsource (Job created, Job assigned, and Job status changed). This release is adding a new event (Due Date changed) which allows users to get notified every time a job due date has been changed in a project. </p>
