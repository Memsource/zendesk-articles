<p><strong>Insert Numbered Tags From a List</strong></p>
<p>Using the shortcut <em>CTRL+comma</em>, users can now select tags from a list to insert into a target segment. This new feature makes handling tags even faster and more flexible.</p>
<p>We have also recently <a href="https://www.memsource.com/blog/2018/05/15/new-option-for-inserting-numbered-tags-in-editors/">added a keyboard shortcut</a> to make it easier to specify the tag number and position of tags in the target segment. The list option builds on this feature as more than 9 tags from a source segment can be shown at once.</p>
<p>The gif shows the new list feature in action:</p>
