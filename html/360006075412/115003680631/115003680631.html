<p>Users are managed by either clicking the <strong>Setup </strong>icon and clicking on <strong>Users </strong>in the <em>Administration </em>section, or by clicking on <strong>Users </strong>on the left side of the screen.</p>
<p>The types of users available in the different <a href="https://www.memsource.com/pricing/" target="_self">Memsource editions</a> are the same, apart from in the Personal edition.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Each account must have at least one Administrator user.</p>
<p><strong>Personal edition</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">A single Administrator user</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Team Start, Team, Ultimate and Enterprise edition</strong><strong>s</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple Administrator/Project Manager users and Linguist users. It is possible to create an unlimited number of user accounts, but there is a licensing limitation. (See the <em>Unlimited Number of User Accounts</em> section below.)</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="User_Licensing" class="mw-headline">User Licensing</span></h2>
<p>With the exception of the Personal edition, which is free, the monthly subscription price is based on the number of licensed users. Linguist users may not be licensed separately but are always provided in a package with a Project Manager license. For example, the Team and Ultimate editions come with 10 Linguist accounts per Project Manager/Administrator. The Enterprise edition comes with an unlimited amount of users of all types.</p>
<h2><span id="Usernames" class="mw-headline">Usernames</span></h2>
<p>Usernames must be always unique not only in your organization but within the whole of Memsource. A deleted username also cannot be used for creating a new user. It is recommended to use some kind of prefix with your usernames to ensure their uniqueness. For instance, ABC Organization can use ABC_j.doe to distinguish from DEF Company's user DEF_j.doe.</p>
<h2><span id="My_Profile_Setup_Menu" class="mw-headline">My Profile Setup Menu</span></h2>

<h2><span id="Unlimited_Number_of_Users" class="mw-headline">Unlimited Number of User Accounts</span></h2>
<p>It is possible to create an unlimited number of user accounts with the Team Start, Team, Ultimate, and Enterprise editions, but there is a licensing limitation (the number of purchased Project Manager user accounts). The licensing limitation applies to the number of <strong>active</strong> users in the organization's Memsource account at any given time.</p>
<p>For example, if an organization subscribes to 5 Project Manager accounts, they can create any number of PM accounts, but only 5 PM users can be active at any given time. The same applies to Linguist users. </p>
<p>With the Team, Ultimate, and Enterprise editions, the activation/deactivation of user accounts happens automatically. If the limit of licensed users is reached for a particular role, no more users of that type will be able to log in and use Memsource. Administrator and Project Manager users can control which users are active and which are inactive by clicking on <strong>Users</strong> on the left side of the screen.</p>
<p> </p>

</div>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p>In contrast, the Team Start edition does not include the automatic activation/deactivation of users; users have to be activated and deactivated manually. Only activated users will be able to log in and use Memsource. </p>
<p>This makes the Team Start edition more suitable for more stable teams and the Team, Ultimate, and Enterprise editions more appropriate for teams which change more regularly.  </p>

<p>The <strong>Email Login</strong> button at the top of the <em>Users </em>section makes it possible to send login information to any number of users. There is an email template that is associated with this step and users, upon receiving the login information, will be able to generate a password for themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The password used when the account was created will not be sent via email for security reasons.</p>
<h2><span id="Import" class="mw-headline">Import</span></h2>
<div class="thumb tright">
<div class="thumbinner">
<p>If you need to create several users at the same time, you can do this by importing an XLSX table. The table itself needs to have a pre-defined format in order to be uploaded successfully. This can be downloaded by clicking on the <strong>Import </strong>button in the <em>Users </em>section and then clicking on the link to download a <strong>sample XLSX file.</strong></p>
<p>The following user information is supported via the batch import:</p>
<ul>
<li>First name</li>
<li>Last name</li>
<li>Email</li>
<li>Username</li>
<li>Password</li>
<li>Role</li>
<li>Receive newsletter</li>
<li>Note</li>
</ul>
<p>Below, you'll see a screenshot of the Excel file that you can download. Start entering your new users in column 4. Fields that are not included in this Excel template like <em>Relevancy</em> (source and target languages, domains, etc.) need to be modified in the system after the users have been successfully imported.</p>

<p><strong>Please note: </strong>If the Excel file you're using has users on it that were previously imported into Memsource, you will receive an error for each of those users, and they will not be imported. To avoid seeing this warning, delete those users from the Excel file.</p>
<h2><span id="Administrators" class="mw-headline">Administrators</span></h2>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Each account must have at least one Administrator user.</p>
<p>The Administrator is at the top of the Memsource user hierarchy and consequently has maximum rights. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating/editing/deleting projects, jobs, translation memories, and term bases</li>
<li>Creating/editing/deleting other users</li>
<li>Modifying any of the settings under <strong>Setup</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of licensing, the Administrator and Project Manager are fully interchangeable. This means that if an organization subscribes to 5 Project Manager accounts, they can choose to have anywhere from 1 to 5 Administrators, while the rest are Project Managers.</p>
<h2><span id="Project_Managers" class="mw-headline">Project Managers</span></h2>
<p>Project Manager users have almost the same level of rights as Administrator users with certain exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are not allowed to create/edit/delete Administrator users</li>
<li>They are not allowed to view and modify some of the settings under <strong>Setup </strong>such as:
<ul>
<li>Subscription details</li>
<li>Domains (determined by the settings below)</li>
<li>Subdomains (determined by the settings below)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<strong>Note:</strong> If both client and business units are specified, only projects, templates, TMs, or TBs where both the client and business units are specified will be available.</div>
<h3><span id="Owner" class="mw-headline">Owners</span></h3>
<p>In addition, any PM can be assigned as the Owner of a project, project template, TM, or TB created by another user and gain the same user rights as if it had been created by them.</p>
<p>The PM permissions can be set so that they don't have the right to view/edit/delete projects created by other users unless the PM is set as the Owner of the project.</p>
<h4><span id="Job_Owner" class="mw-headline">Job Owner</span></h4>
<p>Apart from being the Owner of the entire project, project template, TM, or TB, Project Managers and Administrators can also become Job Owners. Each user who imports a job into a project will automatically become its Job Owner and can receive notifications of the status changes of such jobs. </p>
<h2><span id="Linguists" class="mw-headline">Linguists</span></h2>
<p>The main purpose of the Linguist user role is to translate/edit/proofread, etc. This is a typical scenario related to the Linguist user role:</p>
<ol>
<li>A Project Manager or Administrator creates a Linguist user.</li>
<li>The Project Manager or Administrator then assigns a translation job to the Linguist.</li>
<li>The Linguist user signs in to the <a title="Linguist Portal" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003944792-Linguist-Portal">Linguist Portal</a> and completes the assignment.</li>
</ol>
<p>This type of scenario is typical for translation companies, and the Linguist user has indeed been designed for their freelance translators. Therefore, Linguists are not allowed to do any project management tasks or change project settings for the jobs they have been assigned. They are, however, offered a number of features through the Linguist Portal that are related to the job they have been assigned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download files (unless blocked by the Project Manager)
<ul>
<li>Original</li>
<li>Bilingual MXLIFF, DOCX, TMX</li>
<li>Completed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Join files</li>
<li>Pre-translate from the project TM/MT (for instance to prepare files for offline work)</li>
<li>Change a job status (e.g. to Accepted, Completed, or Rejected)</li>
<li>View project analyses (as assigned to them by a Project Manager)</li>
<li>Search/browse the <a class="external text" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003692212-Translation-Memories" target="_self" rel="nofollow">translation memory</a> (If the option <strong>Edit translation in TM</strong> has been selected, then the TM <em>Write</em> mode can be edited in the Linguist Portal.)</li>
<li>Search/browse terminology (If multiple term bases are selected for a project, only the ones in <em>Write</em> mode are displayed to the Linguist in the Linguist Portal.)</li>
<li>Create/edit terms with <em>New </em>status</li>
<li>Edit terms with <em>Approved </em>status if the option <strong>Edit all terms in TB</strong> has been selected for the Linguist by the Project Manager</li>
<li>Export terms they created themselves</li>
<li>Download reference files</li>
</ul>
<p>The Linguist or Vendor can also decide whether to complete the assignment in either of the Memsource Editors unless file downloads are blocked by the Project Manager. In that case, only the Memsource Editor for Web will be available.</p>
<p>The Team Start, Team, Ultimate, and Enterprise editions also support an additional feature related to Linguist users. Memsource "learns" based on previous Linguist assignments and automatically suggests <a title="Memsource Cloud User Manual" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002826032-Editing-of-job-s-parameters#Relevant_Linguists_1">relevant Linguists</a> to Project Managers when assigning jobs. The information regarding Linguists' previous assignments is saved to the <em>User Detail</em> page and can be also manually edited.</p>
<h3><span id="Custom_setting_for_Linguist_Roles" class="mw-headline">Custom Settings for Linguist Roles</span></h3>
<p>The Linguist role can also be customized using the following options (Please note that some are available only in specific editions.):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Time Zone</strong> - the job's "due date" information will be displayed accordingly</li>
<li>
<strong>Edit all terms in TB</strong> - Linguists will be able to edit/delete terms created by other users and set <em>New</em> terms to <em>Approved</em> (only for TBs connected to the assigned job).</li>
<li>
<strong>Edit translations in TM</strong> - Linguists will be able to open the <em>Writable</em> TMs in projects and edit/delete TM records (This will only affect TMs connected to the assigned job. All of the TM's languages will be available to edit.)</li>
<li>
<strong>Reject job</strong> - only available for Ultimate and Enterprise editions</li>
<li>
<strong>Enable MT</strong> - If disabled, Linguists will not see MT suggestions in the Memsource Editor, even if the MT has been enabled for the project in question.</li>
<li><strong>Receive Memsource newsletters</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Net rate scheme</strong> (for Analysis)</li>
<li>
<strong>Price list</strong> (for Quotes)</li>
<li><strong>Note</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Relevancy</strong> - When assigning a job to the Linguist, this will help with choosing the <a title="Memsource Cloud User Manual" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003691852-Jobs#Relevant_Linguists_1">relevant Linguists</a> from the list. You can add the following information for each Linguist:
<ul>
<li>Source languages</li>
<li>Target languages</li>
<li>Client</li>
<li>Domain</li>
<li>Subdomain</li>
<li>Workflow steps</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Linguists' Relevancy may be set up manually when creating or editing Linguists, or you can allow Memsource to "learn" these attributes based on how you assign the Linguists to the specific Workflow steps.</p>
