<p>MXLIFF documents are primarily intended for translation inside Memsource Editor or to be imported into Memsource directly via the UI. To import an MXLIFF file into SDL Trados as a translatable file, change its extension to XLIFF first. (.MXLIFF files are not automatically recognized by SDL Trados, so they are imported as reference documents.)</p>
<p>Please note: When translating MXLIFF documents outside of Memsource, we cannot guarantee how the files will be processed by other software.</p>
<h2>Known Issues with SDL Trados</h2>
<p><u>Issue:</u> While translating MXLIFF in SDL Trados, the resulting MXLIFF document cannot be opened nor imported back to Memsource.</p>
<p><u>Solution:</u> SDL Trados adds additional information to XLIFF documents that are not a native part of an MXLIFF document. In order to produce a valid MXLIFF document, the option <strong>Do not store segmentation information in the translated file </strong>needs to be turned on in the <em>XLIFF File Import Settings</em>.</p>
