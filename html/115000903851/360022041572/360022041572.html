<p>The following are some of the errors you might see when using the Linguist Portal:</p>
<h2>Setting the Job to "Completed" Failed. Unresolved QA Warnings</h2>
<p>The Project Manager can set strict rules about Quality Assurance. In this case, the Linguist must run a QA check and fix all the problems before setting the job to <em>Completed</em>. In some cases, it is possible to set the QA warning to <em>Ignore</em>.</p>
<p>Please see more details in our <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003643552-Panes#QA_Pane">QA Pane</a> article.</p>
<h2 title='What does the following error mean: "Preceding workflow step not completed (45% confirmed)" ?'>Preceding Workflow Step Not Completed</h2>
<p>When working as a Reviewer in a project with Workflow steps, you might see this warning.<br>If the Project Manager restricts work on a higher step before the previous step is 100% completed, then you won't be able to open the job.</p>
<p>In some cases, you might receive an email that a job is ready for review, but it is still not completed. This can happen when the job in the previous step is split into more jobs; some of them might be completed and some are still waiting.</p>
