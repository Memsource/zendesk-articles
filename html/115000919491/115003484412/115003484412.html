<p>Memsource Mobile App allows users to directly connect to their Memsource account on their mobile phones and similar devices. </p>

<p>The App currently allows users to both create and manage their ongoing projects on the go, work with existing Translation Memories and Term Bases and/or view Analyses. </p>

<p>To learn more about the Memsource Mobile App, you can read our dedicated blogpost - <a href="https://www.memsource.com/blog/2017/03/27/announcing-the-memsource-mobile-app/">Announcing the Memsource Mobile App</a> - or visit the section or the dedicated section of our documentation - <a href="http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Mobile_App">Memsource Mobile App</a>.</p>
<p>Here are basic instructions on how to work with the Memsource Mobile App. </p>
<p> </p>
<h1>Project Managers</h1>
<p>Project Managers using the Mobile App can see the overview of the projects created in the linked Memsource account, and manage the projects directly from the application.</p>
<div>
<h2>
<br> Navigation</h2>
<p>The top panel shows <strong>All, Overdue, In Progress </strong>and <strong>My </strong>projects. This gives Project Managers easy access to all the relevant projects at hand. Due dates are displayed on the right hand side of the screen, with overdue project dates highlighted in red. Approaching deadlines are also indicated in yellow.</p>
</div>

<h2>Project Creation</h2>

<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Using the </span><strong style="font-size: 13px;">+ </strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">button it is possible to create new projects directly from the App. This allows Project Managers to create projects using their devices. A simplified UI also includes the selection of existing metadata (Clients, Domains, etc.), using Project Templates or setting the project Due Date. </span></p>
<h2>Project Management</h2>
<p>Opening a project will bring up the Project interface (containing information like the source and target languages, selected workflow steps, due date, etc.), plus dedicated sections for Translation Memories, Term Bases, Jobs and Analyses. </p>
<div>
<p><strong>Jobs, TM </strong>and <strong>TB </strong>sections allow users to browse the attached resources, and to attach additional ones (TMs and TBs can only be selected from those already created in the account, Jobs can also be imported directly). It is possible to add files directly from the mobile device (Memsource Mobile App will be suggested as an option for the supported file formats).<br> <strong>Analyses</strong> need to be created in the accounts first before they can be viewed in the Mobile App.<br>  </p>

</h1>
<h2>Navigation</h2>
<p>Similar to Memsource Cloud UI, Linguists see a different navigation panel in the Mobile App. The panels available in the App are the same as in the Memsource Cloud UI - <strong>New, Accepted, Completed</strong> projects. </p>
<h2>Managing Assignments</h2>
<p>Once Linguists receive an email notification, they no longer need to go to the Memsource Cloud UI via their browsers. They can use the App to directly view assignments at hand, check important details like language combination and due dates and directly accept new assignments in the application itself. </p>
<p>The Project view shows project Due Dates as well as color warnings for approaching deadlines. </p>
