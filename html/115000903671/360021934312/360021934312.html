<h2>Create a New Term</h2>
<p>To create a new term, open the term base and click on the <strong>New</strong> button. The <em>Terms</em> dialogue window will be displayed. If a multilingual term base is being created, terms can be added in all languages at once.</p>

<p>It is also possible to add a term in one target language even when that term already exists in other TB languages. You can do this by hovering the mouse over the empty target and clicking on the blue plus sign (<strong>+</strong>)<strong> </strong>as shown below:</p>

<h2>Add or Edit a Term's Attributes</h2>
<p>You can add or edit the attributes in your <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003681851-Term-Bases">term base</a>. In order to do this, go to the <em>Term Bases </em>page and click on the name of your term base. You will see a list of all the terms currently in your TB. Any term in this list can be edited, regardless of whether you select the term in the source or the target language. Once you select the term, you'll be taken to a screen where you can edit it.</p>

<h3>Editable Attributes</h3>
<p>In the <em>Edit Term </em>section, you'll find a list of attributes that you can edit:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Term</strong></li>
<li><strong>Language</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Status</strong> (New or Approved)
<ul>
<li>Terms added by Linguists have the <em>New</em> status by default.</li>
<li>Terms created by Project Managers, Guests, or Terminologists (Linguists with special terminology <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003461731-Roles-available-in-Memsource-Cloud#_Linguists" rel="noopener">user rights</a>) have the status <em>Approved</em>.</li>
<li>Linguists may only edit terms with the <em>New </em>status, including those created by other Linguist users.</li>
<li>Project Managers, Guests, or Terminologists may edit any term and can set the term status (e.g. from <em>New</em> to <em>Approved</em>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Preferred</strong>
<ul>
<li>If there are multiple terms that are similar, it is possible to mark one as the <strong>Preferred</strong> term.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Forbidden</strong>
<ul>
<li>When a term is marked as <strong>Forbidden, </strong>Linguists will be informed to not use it. The QA check will show a warning if this term is used in the target.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Case Sensitive</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Match Type</strong> (Fuzzy or Exact)
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Fuzzy</strong> matches will also show results for "<em>cars"</em> if the term that searched for is "<em>car". </em>For languages with rich morphology, a pipe can be used to <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003484072-Term-Morphology">improve matching</a> (meaning that <em>morpholog|y</em> will also match <em>morpholog|ic</em>).</li>
<li>
<strong>Exact </strong>matches will, of course, only match that exact term.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Usage Example</strong>
<ul>
<li>A usage example for the target term will be displayed in the Memsource Editor. This can help provide context for a term and minimize errors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Note</strong>
<ul>
<li>When creating a note, be aware that only the note set for the target term will be displayed in the Memsource Editor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
