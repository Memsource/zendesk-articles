<h2>Renaming Files</h2>
<p>File renaming is used to automatically rename downloaded (translated) files. It can be set up in the general Setup under <em>Project Settings </em>(affecting only newly created projects) or for individual projects (by going to the job and selecting <strong>Edit</strong>).</p>
<p>The following macros are supported with the <strong>Rename completed files to</strong> option:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>{path}</strong> - This is only for files imported in ZIP format with a folder structure.</li>
<li>
<strong>{fileName}</strong> - It is also possible to remove characters from the original file name, using {filename[0:-3]} for example.</li>
<li><strong>{sourceLang}</strong></li>
<li><strong>{targetLang}</strong></li>
<li><strong>{workflow}</strong></li>
<li><strong>{status}</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>{date}</strong> - the date that the file was downloaded, in the PM's timezone</li>
<li>
<strong>{time}</strong> - the time that the file was downloaded, in the PM's timezone</li>
<li>
<strong>{userName}</strong> - of the assigned Linguist or Vendor. If multiple Linguists are assigned, the name will be empty.</li>
<li>
<strong>{replaceExt[po]}</strong> - replaces the extension of the file. For example, the original file <em>test.POT</em> will be downloaded as <em>test.PO</em>. The extension will be replaced by the one in the [ ] brackets. Please note that changing the extension will not change the format itself. That is, renaming 'docx' to 'xlsx' will not change a Word file into an Excel file.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Here's an example of how this works. By copying the following script:</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent4">{path}/{filename}-{sourceLang}-{targetLang}-{workflow}-{status}-{date}-{time}-{userName}</p>
<p>You'll get a file named: </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent4"><em>Completed file:</em> testing/TestFile-en_us-ja-T-C-20160110-0912-ling1.xlf</p>
<p>If <strong>Rename completed files to</strong> is not selected in a project with multiple target languages, and the user decides to download multiple jobs with different targets, the downloaded ZIP file will have folders with language codes added.</p>
<h2>Renaming Analyses</h2>
<p>The default analysis name "Analysis #1", etc can be changed manually, or by using these macros:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>{projectName}</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>{sourceLang}</strong> - This results in a name with the source language name added (the same as it does with file renaming).</li>
<li>
<strong>{targetLang}</strong> - This results in a name with the target language added. If multiple languages are analyzed, the language will be empty.</li>
<li>
<strong>{userName}</strong> - This will include the username of the assigned Linguist or Vendor. If multiple Linguists are assigned, the name will be empty.</li>
<li><strong>{workflow}</strong></li>
<li><strong>{innerId}</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>These renaming patterns can be set up in multiple places:</p>
<ul>
<li>The main Setup page (This will change the renaming patterns for the whole organization.)</li>
<li>Inside of a project</li>
<li>In a project template</li>
<li>In the Analyze dialog window (when creating a new analysis)</li>
</ul>
