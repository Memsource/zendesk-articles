<p><strong>Adding a Single TM in Read-Only Mode</strong></p>
<p>It is now possible to add a single TM in <em>Read-only </em>mode to a project, without needing to also have a TM in <em>Write</em> mode. The single <em>Read-only </em>TM can be added for all Workflow steps or for just some of these steps.</p>
