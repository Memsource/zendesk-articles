<p>Segments can be saved to a translation memory in several ways, depending on the type of user and the user's permission settings. Below, we'll go over how to save these segments for both Linguist users and Project Managers.</p>
<p><strong>Important: </strong>In some special cases, segments are not saved to the translation memory:</p>
<ul>
<li>When working offline in the Memsource Editor for your desktop.</li>
<li>When <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002841231-Pre-translate-Jobs">pre-translating</a> a job with the <em>Set segment status to confirmed for... </em>box checked.</li>
<li>While importing an <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004593692-XLIFF-2-0">XLIFF </a>file as a new job with<em><strong> </strong></em>the <em>Set segment confirmed when...</em> box checked.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Linguists and Vendors</h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Linguists and Vendors can save segments to a translation memory only if that TM has been assigned to a project as <em>"writable"</em>. (The Project Manager will have to check the <em>Write</em> checkbox to do this. If it's not checked, the Linguist or Vendor will not be able to edit any segments.)</p>
<ol>
<li>The first way that a Linguist or Vendor can edit a TM is by<strong> </strong><a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003484832-Confirming-segments">confirming the segments</a> in the Memsource Editor during the translation process. The Editor must be online, and the Linguist must be signed in for the TM to be updated.</li>
<li>The second way is to upload a translated bilingual file to a project via the desktop editor. Do this by going to <strong>Menu</strong> and clicking on <strong>Upload to Server. </strong>Additionally, a Linguist can also use the Linguist Portal by selecting the job, clicking <strong>Tools </strong>in the <em>Jobs </em>section, and then clicking<em> Upload...</em>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Project Managers</h2>
<ol>
<li>Project Managers can upload a bilingual file to a project by first going to the job's page. Click on <strong>Tools </strong>and select <em>Upload...</em> (Please note: In order for this to work, the TM assigned to the project must be <em>"writable"</em>. This is done when the Project Manager checks the <em>Write </em>checkbox when uploading the initial file.)</li>
<li>You can also import a standard <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004593692-XLIFF-2-0">XLIFF </a>file as a new job. Under the<em> File Import </em>Settings, check the <em>Save confirmed segments to TM on import</em> box<em>. </em>This will ensure<em> </em>that<em> </em>all segments that get imported to Memsource as <em>confirmed </em>will be saved as long as <em>Write </em>mode is enabled.</li>
<li>While not recommended, it is possible to <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011103391-Import-content-to-Translation-Memory#MXLIFF_Import">import the bilingual MXLIFF</a> directly to the translation memory.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Translation Unit Metadata</h2>
<p>The segments are saved into translation memory as translation units with specific attributes. Please see our <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360014670152" target="_self">Translation Unit Metadata</a> article for more details.</p>
