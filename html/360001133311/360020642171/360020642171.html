<h2>New Features and Improvements</h2>
<p><strong>Filtering Segments by Tag Content</strong></p>
<p>If the tags are expanded in the editor, users can now also filter segments by the content of these tags. This allows Linguists or Project Managers to easily identify tags with problematic formatting.</p>
<h2>Fixed Bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Repetition arrows were not greyed out if the <strong>Auto-propagate repetitions</strong> option was disabled in the project. This bug is now fixed. </li>
<li>Ignoring one of the QA warnings for a given segment automatically ignored multiple warnings for the same segment. This issue has now been resolved.</li>
</ul>
