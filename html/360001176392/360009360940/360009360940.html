<h2 id="New_Features_and_Improvements">Fixed Bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>When using COTI in a project with Workflow steps, sometimes only the first Workflow step would be uploaded back into the online repository. This has now been fixed. </li>
<li>Due to a bug, projects that used language locales with Portuguese (pt_br and pt_pt) were not always able to use Microsoft Custom MT. This has been resolved.</li>
<li>When a Continuous job that had been previously set to <em>Completed</em> was changed, a webhook would not always be generated for the project. This has now been resolved.</li>
<li>When using REST APIs, the tagRegexp response would sometimes return as <em>null</em> even if it had previously been defined. This is now fixed.</li>
</ul>
