<p>Projects are the central elements of Memsource, where its main components (<a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003691852-Jobs">jobs</a>, <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003692212-Translation-Memories">translation memories</a>, and <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003681851-Term-Bases">term bases</a>) are combined together. To translate a file using Memsource, a project needs to be created before any file can be added for translation.</p>

For instance, a typical workflow would be something like this: Translation → Editing → Proofreading. These are called Workflow Steps, and they can be customized in the <a class="mw-redirect" title="MemSource Cloud User Manual" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003692532-Setup#Workflow_Steps">Workflow Steps</a> section of the <em>Setup </em>page.

Then click on <strong>Workflow</strong> at the bottom of the <em>Settings </em>section and select the workflow steps you want to activate for the project. For new projects, the workflow can be activated immediately during project creation.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The maximum limit is 15 workflow steps in a project.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Each of these sections contains color-coded status bars that reflect the progress of the project in real time based on the number of characters in the project. You can hover over the bar to display a tooltip with a more detailed breakdown of the given section. The following color coding is used for the Project Dashboard:</div>
</div>
</div>
<ul>

<strong>Yellow:</strong> Issue (a Warning)</li>
<li>
<strong>Red:</strong> Issue (Critical)</li>
<li>
<strong>Gray:</strong> All other information</li>

<p>The Project Dashboard also tracks the job creation date and the due date as well as the status of individual jobs. If a warning is present in the project, a box will appear in the respective section of <em>Individual Progress</em>. Click on the box to receive a breakdown of the issues. Click on the warning itself to filter jobs based on the content of the warning (e.g. overdue jobs). The following warnings are displayed in the Project Dashboard:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issues for <strong>accepted jobs:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Due in 24 hours (Warning)</li>
<li>Overdue (Critical)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Issues for jobs that are <strong>not accepted:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Not accepted (Warning)—This is displayed for the first workflow step 12 hours after the job was created.</li>

<h4>Selecting Translation Memories for Projects</h4>

<div class="thumbcaption"><em><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-small">Selecting a TB for a project</span></em></div>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>You can select up to 10 TBs for one project.</li>
<li>Only one can be set as writable.</li>
<li>In the Editor, the TBs are searched and matches are displayed in the same order as they are set in the project.</li>
</ul>
<p><br>There are two ways of selecting a term base for a project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the <strong>Create New</strong> button to create a new TB and select it for your project at the same time.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Select</strong> button to select an existing TB for your project. Select the <strong>Read</strong> and <strong>Write</strong> check boxes in the new window next to the desired TB and click on the <strong>Save</strong> button (do not click on the TB name).</li>
</ol>
<p><br>The sections below explain the available options when selecting a TB for a project.</p>
<h4><span id="Term_Base_Read_and_Write_Mode" class="mw-headline">Term Base Read and Write Mode</span></h4>
<p>One or more TBs can be selected for a project. You can select up to 10 TBs in <strong>Read</strong> mode, but only one of the TBs can be selected for use in <strong>Write </strong>mode. However, it is not necessary to have a TB in <strong>Write</strong> mode selected in your projects.</p>
<p>The read and write mode explained:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Write</strong>: When new terms are created in Memsource Editor, they are saved in the TB that has <strong>Write</strong> mode active.</li>
<li>
<strong>Read</strong>: Memsource will connect to these term bases to retrieve terminology matches.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="Relevant_Term_Bases" class="mw-headline">Relevant Term Bases</span></h4>
<p>This feature makes it easier for project managers to select the right term bases by offering them <em>Relevant</em> TBs automatically. Term bases are offered as relevant during the selection process when the TB and the project share any of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Client</li>
<li>Domain</li>
<li>Subdomain</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="Selecting_Term_Bases_with_different_locales" class="mw-headline">Selecting Term Bases with Different Locales</span></h4>
<p>Memsource allows you to add a TB to a project with the same language but a different locale. For example, a project with the combination DE—EN_US can have a TB assigned with the combination of DE—EN_GB. Generally, all languages with the same prefix can be added (EN, EN_GB, EN_UK, and so forth).</p>
<p>However, for certain languages, the code has a different prefix. For example, Norwegian has the code "NO" and Norwegian (Bokmål) has code "nb-NO”—these two languages cannot be mixed.</p>
<h4><span id="Selecting_whether_Quality_Assurance_Is_Applied" class="mw-headline">Selecting whether Quality Assurance Is Applied</span></h4>
<p>A term base will be included in the Quality Assurance check if the checkbox under the QA column is checked.</p>
<h4><span id="Selecting_Term_Bases_for_Projects_with_Multiple_Target_Languages" class="mw-headline">Selecting Term Bases for Projects with Multiple Target Languages</span></h4>
<p>When selecting TBs for projects with multiple target languages, the user can decide whether to select a TB that matches all the project's target languages or whether to select TBs for specific target languages only.</p>
<h3><span id="Reference_Files" class="mw-headline">Reference Files</span></h3>
<p>One or more reference files can be attached to a project. Or you can write a note if you prefer.</p>
<p>Reference files and notes do not appear in Memsource Editor. Linguists users can download the files or see the notes in the <a title="Linguist Portal" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003944792-Linguist-Portal">linguist portal</a>.</p>
<h2><span id="Project_Templates" class="mw-headline">Project Templates</span></h2>
<p>Project templates make it possible to speed up project creation of repetitive projects and also reduce the risk of human error. Any project can be saved as a template through the <strong>Save as </strong>button located on the <em>Project Detail</em> page. See the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003483952-Project-Templates">project template</a> article for more details.</p>
<h2><span id="Clone_Projects" class="mw-headline">Clone Projects</span></h2>
<p>Any project can be <strong>cloned</strong> through the <strong>Save as</strong> button, located in the project detail page. Cloned projects inherit project settings from the original project (e.g. attached translation memories and term bases, Workflow, Pre-translation, and Machine translation settings, source and target languages, Client, Domain, etc.).</p>
