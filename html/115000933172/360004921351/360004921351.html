<p>This article provides a step-by-step guide to using the Linguist Portal. </p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>As a Linguist, when you are first provided with a Memsource account, you will receive an email that contains your username and a link to generate a password. Use these credentials to log into your Linguist account from <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://www.memsource.com/">memsource.com</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Once you have logged in, you will be presented with the Linguist Portal.</p>
<p>The navigation panel in the Memsource Linguist account provides a Jobs View and a Projects View.</p>
<h3>Jobs View</h3>
<div class="thumb tright">
<div class="thumbinner">
<div class="thumbcaption">Translation jobs assigned to the linguist are presented in a table with acceptance buttons and filtering options. Information about the jobs is presented in columns that can be used to sort the jobs. Columns can be customized and saved. If a linguist is removed from a job, it will not appear in the list.</div>
<div class="thumbcaption"> </div>
<h4 class="thumbcaption">Main Filter options</h4>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>All: </strong>All jobs, current and past.</li>
<li>
<strong>Accepted Work: </strong>Translation jobs that have been accepted by the Linguist and have not yet been completed.</li>
<li>
<strong>Completed Work: </strong>Translation jobs that have been marked as <strong>Completed by Linguist</strong>. Once set to <em>Completed</em>, the job is no longer editable for the Linguist, but can still be opened as Read-only. Linguists still can add or reply to a comment in the Conversation in jobs marked as <em>Completed</em>.</li>
<li>
<strong>New Work: </strong>Jobs that have not been accepted by the Linguist are displayed here. The Status field can be used to accept or decline translation jobs.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="Project_Details" class="mw-headline">Projects View</span></h3>
<div class="thumb tright">
<div class="thumbinner">
<div class="thumbcaption">Projects associated with the linguist are presented in a sortable list. </div>
<div class="thumbcaption">Click on a project to view Project Details:</div>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Translation Jobs.</li>
<li>Wordcount Analysis (if assigned to the Linguist by the PM).</li>
<li>Quotes (if assigned to the project)</li>
<li>Translation Memory (if assigned to the project).</li>
<li>Term Base (if assigned to the project).</li>
<li>Reference files (if assigned to the project).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Open a project that you have been assigned to. You will see an overview of all the resources available, including jobs for translation, analyses (including the word count), translation memories and term bases, and references. If a job includes a deadline, it is automatically adjusted based on the timezone specified in your account settings.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: </strong>You also have the option of managing your personal settings and changing your password in your profile page. To change the settings, click on the <strong>Setup</strong> gear icon in the top right-hand corner of the Memsource UI. </p>
