<p>When you first log in as a Linguist user, you will immediately be taken to the jobs dashboard, which will look something like this:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The dashboard provides an overview of all the jobs you are currently assigned to and the status of each. In addition to the <em>New, Accepted, </em>and <em>Completed</em> statuses which are used in Memsource, the Mobile App also includes <em>Overdue Jobs, Due in 24 hrs</em>, and <em>Cancelled Jobs</em>, making it easier for you to prioritize and plan your work. </p>
<p>If you select any of these sections, you will be taken to a list of the relevant jobs. You can search this list using the search bar, or narrow the search further by using the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004056431">filter options</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When you log in as a Project Manager, you will be taken to a <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004017292">Project Dashboard</a>. </p>
<h2>Reviewing Jobs</h2>
<p>If you’ve received a notification saying that a job has been assigned to you, it’s important to respond as soon as possible. With the Memsource Mobile App, you can review all the key details about a job and even view the original source file even, if you don’t have your computer with you.</p>
<p>The key information about a job can be seen in the <em>Jobs</em> list. If you want to find out more, select the job. To see the original source file, press the three dots (<strong>...</strong>) in the top right-hand corner. From this Job detail page, you can also change the status of jobs (see the next bit below). </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> With an iOS device, you can preview the file from the app. With an Android device, you need to download and open the file.</p>
<h2>Accepting, Declining, and Marking Jobs as Complete</h2>
<p>Once you’ve reviewed the source file, you can choose to either accept or decline the job. If you accept the job, you can then <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030651232" target="_self">edit</a> the job in the Memsource Mobile app. Once the job is complete, you can also set the job to <em>Completed</em>.</p>
