<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Sharing in Memsource primarily means sharing resources between separate organizations in Memsource. Currently, this means shared projects and shared jobs, although the <a title="Instant Quotes" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003941812-Automation-Widget">Automation Widget</a> can also fall under this category, to an extent</p>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p>In Memsource, a sharing is a connecting two cooperating organizations: a "Buyer" and a "Vendor". These are not fixed roles, and only determine the relationship. This means that for some projects, an organization can act as a Buyer, while for others it can act as a Vendor.</p>
<p>Sharing is available in all of our paid editions.</p>
<h3>Buyer</h3>
<p>A Buyer is an organization with an account in Memsource that can assign projects to other organizations (vendors) in Memsource. This feature is available in Team, Ultimate and Enterprise editions.</p>
<p>Organizations with the following editions can act as buyers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Team</li>
<li>Ultimate</li>
<li>Enterprise</li>
</ul>
<h3>Vendor</h3>
<p>A Vendor is an organization that can be assigned projects or jobs by other organizations (Buyers).</p>
<p>Organizations with the following editions can act as vendors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Team Start</li>
<li>Team</li>
<li>Ultimate</li>
<li>Enterprise</li>
</ul>
<h3>Vendor Connection</h3>
<p>A Buyer needs to establish the Vendor connection before sharing projects or jobs with them. The Vendor organization needs to provide its <em>Vendor Token</em> to the Buyer in order to set it up.</p>
<p>The Vendor Token is located at the top of the Vendor organization's <strong>Setup</strong> page in the <em>Organization </em>section of Memsource.<img class="img350" title="Vendor token" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/7cs29xnkzymgq49/setup_VendorToken.png?raw=1"></p>
<p>After receiving the token from the vendor, the buyer organization can go ahead and add the new vendor to their vendor list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to Setup and click on Vendors in the Administration section. Then, click New.</li>
<li>Enter the Vendor token</li>
<li>You can also add a net rate scheme and price list (if applicable)</li>
<li>You also set the Relevancy of this vendor (the Vendor will be offered as "Relevant" in the Providers list when sharing a project or jobs): source and target languages, clients, domains, subdomains, and Workflow.</li>
<li>Save the Vendor and you are ready to share projects or jobs with them.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Shared Projects</h2>
<p>Shared projects make it possible for separate organizations in Memsource to collaborate while using their own resources (for example, translation memories, term bases, or users). For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>A corporate Memsource customer can share a project with a translation company.</li>
<li>A Multi-Language Vendor can share projects with Single-Language Vendors.</li>
<li>A translation company can share projects with Memsource users who have a Team Start account, instead of only being able to assign them to <a title="MemSource Cloud User Manual" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003461731-Roles-available-in-Memsource-Cloud#_Linguists">Linguist users</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Getting Started with Shared Projects</h3>
<p>After the buyer sets up the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003691632#Vendor_Connection" target="_self">Vendor connection,</a> the button "Share" will be active on project page and the Buyer can now start sharing projects with the Vendor. Also, the Vendor can transfer their project to Buyer.</p>
<p><img class="img450" title="Share button in a Project" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/eeyq8dioy2n94ce/PR_ShareButton.png?raw=1"></p>
<p>A distinct <em>Shared Project</em> icon is displayed for shared projects.</p>
<p><img class="img250" title="Share project icon" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2ntnwabpgu4r0tp/project_shared.png?raw=1"></p>
<p>To unshare a project, follow the same steps as for sharing and select the first empty line in the vendors list.</p>
<p><img class="img250" title="Unshare project" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/xp5gyr3l5obo51w/PR_shareVendorList.png?raw=1"></p>
<h3>Shared Project Owners</h3>
<p>Once the Buyer organization creates a new Vendor (effectively creating the Vendor/Buyer relationship), a <em>Buyers </em>list will be displayed for the vendor organization under the Vendor Setup. The connected Buyer organizations will be listed there, and the Vendor will be able to select a default project owner for each Buyer. This is important because all email notifications are sent to project owners. Please note that a shared project will always have two project owners—the Buyer project owner and the Vendor project owner.</p>
<p>It is now also possible to <a title="Sharing" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003691632-Shared-Projects#Transferring_Project_from_Vendor_to_Buyer_1">transfer the project ownership from Vendor to Buyer</a> if the Vendor creates a project and then shares it ex-post with a Buyer.</p>
<h3><span id="Shared_Projects_Email_Notifications" class="mw-headline">Shared Projects Email Notifications</span></h3>
<p>An email notification is sent automatically:</p>
<ol>
<li>To the Vendor project owner when a project is assigned to them by the buyer.</li>
<li>To the Buyer project owner when the status of the shared project is changed by the Vendor.</li>
</ol>
<h3><span id="Shared_Projects_Rights" class="mw-headline">Shared Projects Rights</span></h3>
<p>Our philosophy is to provide a fairly open framework for collaboration that is based on mutual trust between the Buyer and the Vendor. In general, the Buyer has a bigger say than the Vendor, but both can do quite a lot. We also prefer not to "lock" any actions and instead make it possible to revert any unwanted actions (e.g. mistakenly deleted jobs can be recovered from the recycle bin).</p>
<p><strong><span id="Buyer_Rights" class="mw-headline">Buyer Rights</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Buyer has a full right to the project and all Buyer's resources (TM/TB, MT engine, etc.)</li>
<li>the Buyer may not Edit, Export, or Unselect Vendor's TMs/TBs.</li>
<li>The Buyer is not able to see the names of Vendor Linguists.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span id="Vendor_Rights" class="mw-headline">Vendor Rights</span></strong></p>
<p>The Vendor may not:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delete a shared project.</li>
<li>Modify project machine translation settings.</li>
<li>Edit, Export, or Unselect a Buyer's TMs/TBs.</li>
<li>See the names of Buyer's Linguists.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Vendor is allowed to carry out most project management tasks, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create/edit/delete jobs, analyses, and reference files</li>
<li>Split/pre-translate/download jobs</li>
<li>Add subsequent Workflow Steps (Vendor Workflow Steps need to have higher hierarchical order)</li>
<li>Assign Vendor Linguists to jobs</li>
<li>Add vendor TMs</li>
<li>Share jobs with other Vendors</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span id="Deleting_in_a_Shared_Project" class="mw-headline">Deleting in a Shared Project</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When a Vendor deletes an item in a shared project, both the Buyer and Vendor will be able to undelete it from the recycle bin.</li>
<li>When a Buyer deletes an item in a shared project, only the Buyer will be able to undelete it.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="Relevant_Vendors" class="mw-headline">Relevant Vendors</span></h3>
<p>The relevant Vendors feature works just like the <a class="mw-redirect" title="MemSource Cloud User Manual" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003691852-Jobs#Relevant_Linguists_1">relevant Linguists</a> feature.</p>
<h3>Transferring a Project from a Vendor to a Buyer</h3>
<p><img src="https://help.memsource.com/hc/article_attachments/115004628912/Transfer-Project-to-Buyer.png" alt="Transfer-Project-to-Buyer.png" width="597" height="150"></p>
<p>The typical scenario when a Buyer and a Vendor collaborate in Memsource is that the Buyer will initiate a project and then share it with the Vendor. However, there are a number of instances when it is the Vendor who initiates the project and then needs to turn it into a shared project ex-post. With this feature, an existing project created by a Vendor can be turned into a shared project owned by the Buyer and shared with the Vendor. Once transferred, the Buyer will be notified of the new shared project. This feature is only available to organizations that have provided their <a class="mw-redirect" title="MemSource Cloud User Manual" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003692532-Setup#Vendors_1">Vendor token</a> to at least one Buyer. If this is the case, they will be able to see the <em>Buyer list</em> under <strong>Setup </strong>in the <em>Administration </em>section.</p>
<h2>Shared Jobs</h2>
<h3>Shared Jobs Introduction</h3>
<p>The introduction of shared jobs was the next logical step after the introduction of shared projects. Shared projects work really well if a project is shared with a single external vendor. When multiple Vendors need to be used for a project, the solution is to use shared jobs. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>A corporate Memsource customer (Buyer) can share jobs within a project with multiple Vendors where different Vendors are responsible for different target languages.</li>
<li>Or, a Buyer can pick a lead Vendor and share the project with them, while the lead Vendor selects to work multiple sub-Vendors and uses shared jobs for them. (This would be a combination of a shared project and shared jobs within the same project.)</li>
<li>An MLV (Multi-Language Vendor) can assign jobs to SLVs (Single-Language Vendors). Again this is typically based on target language specialization.</li>
<li>It is possible to share project with one Vendor and share jobs in the same project with another Vendor. However sharing the project and its jobs with the same Vendor is not possible.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Getting Started with Shared Jobs</h3>
<p><img src="https://help.memsource.com/hc/article_attachments/115004628992/Assign-Job-to-a-Vendor.png" alt="Assign-Job-to-a-Vendor.png" width="333" height="311"> In order to start a shared job, please follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <a class="mw-redirect" title="MemSource Cloud User Manual" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003461731-Roles-available-in-Memsource-Cloud#Buyer">Buyer</a> should ask the <a class="mw-redirect" title="MemSource Cloud User Manual" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003461731-Roles-available-in-Memsource-Cloud#Vendor">Vendor</a> organization for their <a class="mw-redirect" title="MemSource Cloud User Manual" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003692532-Setup#Vendors_1">Vendor token</a>.</li>
<li>After receiving the token from the Vendor, the Buyer organization can go ahead and add the new Vendor in their <em>Vendor list</em> by going to <strong>Setup</strong> and clicking on <strong>Vendors </strong>in the <em>Administration</em> section.</li>
<li>The Buyer can now start sharing jobs with the Vendor by simply editing a job and assigning it to the Vendor in the same way that jobs are assigned to Linguists.</li>
<li>Jobs assigned to a Vendor are displayed in the same way as jobs assigned to Linguists. A tooltip indicates whether a job is assigned to a Vendor or to a Linguist.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Shared Jobs Rights</h3>
<p>Shared jobs are much more Buyer-driven. And so Vendor rights in a shared job are quite limited in comparison to shared projects where vendors enjoy almost all Project Management rights.</p>
<p><strong>Buyer Rights</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Buyer has full Project Management rights in a shared project.</li>
<li>The Buyer is not able to see the names of the Vendor's Linguists.</li>
<li>The Buyer cannot see nor access Vendor's TM and TB (if Vendor add any to the job)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Vendor Rights</strong></p>
<p>The vendor rights are quite limited in a shared job.</p>
<p>The Vendor may:</p>
<ul>
<li>See only the jobs assigned to the Vendor by the Buyer</li>
<li>See (Buyer's) analyses assigned to the Vendor by the Buyer</li>
<li>Add their own Memsource TM</li>
<li>Add their own Memsource TB</li>
<li>Split and join jobs</li>
<li>Create analyses</li>
<li>Assign shared jobs to the Vendor's Linguists</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Vendor may not:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>See jobs that are not directly assigned to them</li>
<li>See Buyer's analyses that are not assigned to them</li>
<li>Delete jobs</li>
<li>Change the project's settings of Buyer's translation memory or term base</li>
<li>Edit/export Buyer's TMs/TBs.</li>
</ul>
