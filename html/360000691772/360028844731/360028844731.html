<p>Zendesk is a customer service platform that allows companies to create and manage websites. To establish a connection between Zendesk and Memsource, you will first need to set the languages in your Zendesk account. To do this, log in to your Zendesk account. Click on the gear icon on the left-hand side of the screen. Select <strong>Language Settings </strong>and then select <strong>Add new language. </strong>Choose the language(s) you'd like to add and click <strong>Add language. </strong>Once your languages are set up, you can go back to your Memsource account.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You'll need to have popups enabled in order to set this connector up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Memsource, navigate to Setup and scroll down to the <em>Integrations </em>section. Click on <strong>Connectors. </strong>After clicking on <strong>New</strong>, you can choose the connector you wish to create. Give it a name and change the Type to <em>Zendesk.</em><span style="font-weight: bolder;"> </span></p>

<p>For the <em>Host prefix </em>field, enter your the first part of your Zendesk URL. Note that the <em>http:// </em>and <em>.zendesk.com </em>parts of the URL are automatically added, so you'll only need to add the part of the URL that goes in between those two sections. For example, you would type <em>mysupportsite </em>for <a class="external free" style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://mysupportsite.zendesk.com/" rel="nofollow">https://mysupportsite.zendesk.com</a>.</p>
<p>After you've entered your Host prefix, click on <strong>Connect to Zendesk. </strong>If you've set everything up correctly, you'll see a check mark next to the <strong>Connect to Zendesk </strong>button. Then, click <strong>Save.</strong></p>
