<p id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading" lang="en">The Linguist Portal is part of the Team Start, Team, Ultimate, and Enterprise editions. It is a self-service zone for Linguist users in which they can manage translation jobs that have been assigned to them by, for example, a translation agency. Typical tasks that are enabled for Linguists via the Linguist Portal include:</p>

<p>Translation jobs are organized into three tabs (please note that if there is no job under a tab, the tab is not displayed):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>New: </strong>Jobs that have not been accepted by the Linguist are displayed here. The Linguist has to use the button <strong>Change Status</strong> to accept or decline the translation jobs.</li>
<li>
<strong>Accepted: </strong>This tab lists projects with translation jobs that have been accepted by the Linguist and have not yet been completed.</li>
<li>
<strong>Completed: </strong>This tab lists projects with translation jobs that have been marked as <strong>Completed by Linguist</strong>. Once the job is set to Completed, it is no longer editable for the linguist, but it can still be opened as Read-only and Linguists still can add or reply to a comment in the Conversation.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong><span id="Project_Details" class="mw-headline">Project Details</span></strong></h3>

</div>
<p>In the Project Details, the Linguist can see:</p>
<ul>
<li>The jobs for translation</li>
<li>The translation memory of the project (if one has been assigned to the project)</li>
<li>The term base of the project (if one has been assigned)</li>
<li>Wordcount analysis (if one has been assigned to the Linguist by the PM)</li>
<li>Reference files (if any have been assigned to the project)</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever a Linguist changes a job's status, the appropriate Project Manager will be sent an email notification, based on pre-configured <a title="Memsource Cloud User Manual" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003692532-Setup#Email_Templates_1">email templates</a>. The Project Manager can notify Linguists of new jobs assigned to them via the <a title="Email Translation Jobs" href="https://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Email_Translation_Jobs">Email</a> submenu located under the <strong>Download</strong> button in a Memsource project.</p>
<p>The Linguist Portal also includes a <em>Useful Links</em> section, which directs the Linguist to important information resources, such as the <a title="Getting Started Linguists" href="https://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Getting_Started_Linguists">Getting Started Guide for Linguists</a>, information about <a title="Memsource Web Editor User Manual" href="https://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Memsource_Web_Editor_User_Manual">Memsource Editor for the web</a>, or the <a title="Memsource Editor User Manual" href="https://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Memsource_Editor_User_Manual">Memsource Editor User Manual</a>.</p>
