<ul>
<li>After receiving a QA warning for segment #1, the Editor's focus would occasionally shift to the QA pane. This bug has now been fixed. </li>
<li>After translating a document and then undoing all changes, some segments would remain translated. This issue has been fixed. </li>
<li>For very large jobs, after running a QA check, ignoring the first 100 segments, and running the QA check again no longer causes an error. </li>
<li>You can now run a QA check without having a segment selected.</li>
</ul>
