<ul>
<li>Due to a bug, it was not possible to run the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003484052-Quality-Assurance" target="_self">QA check</a> if the dropdown menu was open. This has now been fixed.</li>
<li>When searching a TM or TB using a concordance search, if a new search was done that returned 0 results, the results from the first search would not disappear. If the subsequent search has 0 results, the <em>Search</em> Pane will now be empty.</li>
<li>Due to a bug, it was not possible to use the scroll bars when using the touch screen on a Windows tablet. This has now been resolved.</li>
<li>MT and TB terms that had subscript letters or numbers (such as the 2 in H<sub>2</sub>O) would not be found when using a search. This has now been fixed.</li>
