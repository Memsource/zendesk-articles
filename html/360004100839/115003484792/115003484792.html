<h2>Find and Replace</h2>
<p>In order to activate the Replace feature, you actually need to filter for the contents in question. Type the word or phrase you want to replace into the <em>Filter Target Text</em> field. You will then see a new <em>Replace</em> section appear above the <em>Segment Status </em>section. (If this is not visible to you, click the arrow to the left of the <em>Filter Source Text </em>field to expand this section.) Then, type the word or phrase you want to replace the original text with, and select <strong>Replace</strong> or <strong>Replace All.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>The <em>Replace</em> option for the source language is not available in the Web Editor, only in the Desktop Editor.</p>
<h2>Loading Large Jobs</h2>
<p>Documents in the Web Editor are loaded in batches. Large jobs can take a while to be loaded completely, so you might experience some missing segments at end of your file. Every time you press PageDown or scroll down with your mouse, the page will load more segments—just give it a few seconds.</p>
