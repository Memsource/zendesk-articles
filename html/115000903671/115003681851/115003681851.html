<p>Terminology can help to keep your translations consistent within your <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003680771-Projects">projects</a> and ensure you and/or your translators use the correct terms.</p>
<p>Memsource term bases are concept-based, so a single term in a language can have one or more counterparts in another language. The term base module also supports multiple languages in a single term base.</p>
<h2>Create a New Term Base</h2>
<p>To create a new TB, either click on the <strong>New </strong>button on the <em>Term Bases </em>page or select the plus sign (<strong>+</strong>) next to <em>Term Bases </em>in the left-side menu.</p>
<ul>
<li>Enter a TB <strong>Name.</strong>
</li>
<li>Select <strong>the languages</strong> for your TB. Unlike translation memories, term bases do not make a distinction between source and target languages. A term base can have multiple languages, but for the sake of speed and ease of editing, a maximum of 10-15 languages is recommended. Using 30 languages in a TB is still manageable, but more than 50 languages can cause your TB to become very slow and very hard to work with.</li>
<li>You can select the <em>Client, Business Unit, Domain, </em>and <em>Subdomain</em> (if applicable to your Memsource Edition and the account settings).</li>
<li>You can also add a <strong>Note</strong><em> </em>if you desire.</li>
<li>Hit the <strong>Create</strong> button.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Create a New Term Concept</h2>
<p>A <em>Term concept</em> contains the source term, target terms, and synonyms. Open the term base and click on the <strong>New</strong> button. The <em>Terms</em> dialogue window will be displayed.</p>
<p>If a multilingual term base has been created, terms in all languages can be added at once.</p>
<p><img class="img350" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/cwfdghjy83ktxwx/TB_new_term.png?raw=1"></p>
<p>You can add other terms and synonyms to an existing concept simply by hovering your mouse over the term and clicking on the blue plus (<strong>+</strong>) icon that will appear.</p>

<h2>Term Attributes</h2>
<p>Term attributes can be found in the <em>Term Details</em> page by simply clicking on a term. On this page, you can see the following:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Term</strong></li>
<li><strong>Language</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Status</strong> (<em>New</em> or <em>Approved</em>)
<ul>
<li>Terms added by Linguists have the <em>New</em> status by default.</li>
<li>Terms created by Project Managers, Guests, or Terminologists (Linguists with special terminology <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003461731-Roles-available-in-Memsource-Cloud#_Linguists" rel="noopener">user rights</a>) have the status <em>Approved</em>.</li>
<li>Linguists may only edit terms with the <em>New </em>status, including those created by other Linguist users.</li>
<li>Project Managers, Guests, or Terminologists may edit any term and can set the term status (e.g. from <em>New</em> to <em>Approved</em>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Preferred</strong>: If there are several similar terms, it is possible to mark one as the <strong>Preferred </strong>term.</li>
<li>
<strong>Forbidden</strong>: Linguists will be informed to not use this term; the QA check will show a warning if this term is used in the target.</li>
<li><strong>Case Sensitive</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Match Type</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Fuzzy</strong> matches will also show results for "<em>cars"</em> if the term that searched for is "<em>car". </em>For languages with rich a morphology, a pipe can be used to <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003484072-Term-Morphology">improve matching</a> (meaning that <em>morpholog|y</em> will also match <em>morpholog|ic</em>).</li>
<li>
<strong>Exact </strong>matches will, of course, only match that exact term.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Usage</strong>: A usage example for the target term will be displayed in the Memsource Editor. This can help provide context for a term and minimize errors.</li>
<li>
<strong>Part of Speech</strong>: Select from <em>Adjective, Noun, Verb,</em> or <em>Adverb.</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Gender</strong>: Select from <em>Masculine, Feminine</em>, or <em>Neutral.</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Number</strong>: Select <em>Singular, Plural</em>, or <em>Uncountable.</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Note</strong>: Please be aware that only the target term note will be displayed in Memsource Editor. The source term will not have a note displayed.</li>
<li><strong>Short Translation</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Term Type</strong>: Select <em>Full form, Short form, Acronym, Abbreviation, Phrase,</em> or <em>Variant.</em>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> All of these attributes can be set for both TBX import/export and for XLS import/export.</p>
<h2>Term Base Management</h2>
<p>Terms can be searched, filtered, edited, imported, or exported in the Memsource <em>Term Bases</em> section.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>New</em> terms (not <em>Approved </em>terms) are displayed in grey.</li>

</ul>
<p><img class="img450" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/8d6c6wjn3dslxvo/TB_edit_Multiterm.png?raw=1"></p>
<h3>Search and Filter in a Term Base</h3>
<p>Use the <strong>Search</strong> button to search for a TB term in the selected language. By default, a <a title="Wildcard search" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003929891">wildcard search</a> is used. For an exact search, use quotation marks (such as "red car").</p>
<p>It is possible to <strong>Filter</strong> the searched results using the <em>funnel</em> icon in the top right corner. The filters will appear at the top as a row of fields that can be used to narrow your search. (See the <em>gear</em> icon for a list of columns that can be displayed.)</p>
<p>A new search will reset the filter, you should use <strong>Search</strong> before using the <strong>Filter.</strong></p>
<h2><span id="Terminology_Import" class="mw-headline">Importing Terminology</span></h2>
<p>Terms can be imported from XLS/XLSX and TBX files into a term base. When importing terms, you can decide whether they should be imported as a new term base or if they should be added to an existing term base. For more details, see our <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021885672-Importing-Terminology-into-a-Term-Base" target="_self">Import Content to a Term Base</a> article.</p>
<h2><span id="Update_Terminology" class="mw-headline">Update Terminology</span></h2>
<p>This feature is useful to modify existing terms that are already in a Memsource term base. To do this, just follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Export the terms by clicking on the <strong>Export</strong> button and selecting the attributes that you wish to export. The <em>Concept ID (CID), Term ID (TID), </em>and the <em>Term </em>must be exported. By default, <em>Status </em>is also selected. You can decide to import the <em>Status</em> or not, and you can export any of the other attributes listed here as well.</li>
<li>Make the desired changes in MS Excel—be careful not to delete the CIDs and TIDs.</li>
<li>You can delete terms in one of two ways. Add the suffix <strong>|delete </strong>to the CID to delete it from all languages, or add <strong>|delete </strong>to the TID to delete it from a specific language.</li>
<li>Save the MS Excel file.</li>
<li>Re-import the Excel file. <strong>Important: </strong>before you click on <strong>Import, </strong>make sure you have the option <strong>Update existing terms</strong> selected.</li>
</ol>

<div class="thumbcaption"> </div>
<h2><span id="Export_Terminology" class="mw-headline">Export Terminology</span></h2>
<h4><span id="Export_XLS" class="mw-headline">Export an XLS</span></h4>
<p>To export a term base in XLSX format, click on the <strong>Export</strong> button and then select XLSX. When exporting into an XLSX, select which term attributes you wish to have exported.</p>
<h4><span id="Export_TBX" class="mw-headline">Export a TBX</span></h4>
<p>To export a term base in TBX format, click on the <strong>Export</strong> button and then select <strong>TBX</strong>. The TBX format is ideal if, among other things, you need to import/export terminology between two Memsource term bases. This is because the TBX format is lossless inside the Memsource environment.</p>
<h2><span id="Term_Base_Metadata" class="mw-headline">Term Base Metadata</span></h2>
<p>The following metadata is supported:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Created date/time</li>
<li>Created by</li>
<li>Last modified date/time</li>
<li>Last modified by</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>This metadata is currently only supported for TBX exports.</p>
