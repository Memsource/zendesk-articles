<p>Project Managers are in charge of project management, the creation or modification of projects, assignment creation, and <a class="link" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/sections/360002971060-Resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resources</a> management.</p>
<p>Although Project Managers have almost the same rights as the Administrator, they cannot view or modify the Memsource subscription.</p>

<p>A PM can be assigned as the Owner of a project, project template, TM, or TB created by another user and gains the same user rights as if it had been created by them.</p>
<p>PM permissions can be set so that they don't have the right to view/edit/delete projects created by other users unless the PM is set as the Owner of the project.</p>

<p>Apart from being the Owner of an entire project, project template, TM, or TB, Project Managers and Administrators can also become Job Owners. Each user who imports a job into a project automatically becomes the Job Owner and receives notifications of status changes of such jobs.</p>
