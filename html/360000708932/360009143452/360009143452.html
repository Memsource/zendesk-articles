<p>API returns a paging info in following form: "paging": { "total": 1, "page": 0, "pages": 1 }</p>
<div class="customer_history_ticket_qna_answer a-ticket-meat">
<p>The result says that there is a total of "1 page" and that the results shown apply to page 0 in this case.</p>
<p><br> So "page" is where you are and "pages" is the total number of pages.<br> The results are always shown by 50 items, so you can see something like:</p>
<div class="alert alert-green">
<pre>{<br>
    "paging": {<br>
    "total": 100000,<br>
    "page": 0,<br>
    "pages": 2000<br>
    },</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="a-ticket-footer">"Total" means total items or entries, not total pages.</div>
