<p>Upon Your payment of a subscription fee to Us or when using a free version of Memsource, We grant You personal, non-exclusive, time-limited, non-transferable and revocable license to use Memsource, for as long as You comply with these Terms of Service. All rights not expressly granted in these Terms of Service are reserved.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that You are fully responsible for a timely payment of all subscription fees for Memsource in line with Your subscription plan. If You fail to pay any subscription fee or any other amount payable to Us on its due date, We have the right to terminate Your account and the Agreement with immediate effect.</p>
<p>It is Your responsibility to comply with any obligation to pay any taxes and charges, arising from Your subscription to Memsource, in addition to the subscription fee, should You become subject to such obligations in Your home country.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that if You decide to terminate the Agreement prior to the end of the agreed term of Your Subscription, You are not entitled to claim any part of the subscription fee which is due or has already been paid.</p>
<p>If Your Subscription is based on a per-User pricing, such as the Team Start, Team, and Ultimate subscription plans, We reserve the right to adjust the pricing of the Subscription or any additional services to Our own higher costs once per calendar year, at the beginning of the renewal period, by up to 20 percent. We will notify You of the proposed price adjustment at least 2 months prior to the effective date of the proposed change.

<p>You acknowledge that You are fully responsible for Your use of Memsource, including responsibility for compliance with all laws and regulations that are applicable to You or the content You use in connection with Memsource. You may not use Memsource in any unlawful manner or in any other manner that could damage, disable, or interfere with or reverse engineer Memsource. We may, at Our sole discretion, adopt rules for permitted and appropriate use of Memsource and may update them from time to time. These rules shall form an inseparable part of these Terms of Service and shall be available on Our website. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate provision of Our services immediately to any User whose activity disrupts or causes harm to Memsource infrastructure, or violates these Terms of Service, including the obligation to pay a subscription fee in line with the User’s subscription plan. We also reserve the right to suspend or terminate provision of Our services immediately to any User who is not Your employee or Your contractor.</p>

<p>This Fair Use Policy applies to You only if Your subscription is based on a per-User pricing, such as the Team Start, Team, and Ultimate subscription plans. We typically do not limit the number of words that You upload to Memsource in these subscription plans and expect that Your use will be fair. For the purpose of these Terms of Service, Your use of Memsource is fair if it does not exceed the fair use allowance.</p>
<p>The fair use allowance is a word volume calculated in the following way: 100 words for each EUR (one euro) of Your subscription fee. Words are counted as source words in newly created jobs times the number of target languages. Words are counted towards the “word volume” only once—when a job is created. The job can then be analyzed, translated, and otherwise processed any number of times by any number of users without any impact on the word volume.</p>
<p>Should Your word volume exceed the volume defined as fair use in any three-month period by more than 20%, We have the right to initiate a re-negotiation of the subscription terms with You. If no agreement is reached between You and Us within 30 days, We may terminate Your account and the Agreement with a 30-day notice period during which You may use Your account in line with these Terms of Service and respecting the fair use policy.</p>
<p>Example: If Your monthly subscription fee is EUR 500, then Your monthly fair use allowance is 50,000 words monthly. If You exceed such volume in any given 3-month period by 20%, i.e. would reach 180,000 source words or more in newly created jobs, then We may notify You and initiate re-negotiation of Your subscription terms.</p>

<p>Access to Memsource services via the API is subject to usage limits. The number of permitted calls per logged in user is 6,000 per minute and 2,000 per minute for the users who are not logged in. Should Your number of calls exceed these usage limits more than once in any given day, We have the right to interrupt Your access to Memsource and initiate re-negotiation of Your subscription terms.

<p>Unless otherwise specified, Memsource may not be accessed by more than the number of purchased Users; a User’s password may not be shared with any other individual; and User identification may be reassigned to a new individual only if it replaces another User who no longer requires ongoing use of the Memsource service.</p>
