<h2>New Features and Improvements</h2>
<p><strong>Approved Terms Visually Indicated</strong></p>
<p>Until now, it was only possible to distinguish between <em>New</em><em> </em>and <em>Approved </em>terms using the metadata details at the bottom of the <em>CAT</em> Pane. With the release of this feature, New terms will be marked in grey.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Marking Terms as Preferred</strong></p>
<p>As in Memsource, it is now possible to mark terms as <em>Preferred</em> when creating them from within the Memsource Editor for Web. The preferred translations can be identified by their designation at the bottom of the <em>CAT</em> Panel (in the metadata section).</p>

<h2>Fixed Bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Due to a bug in the web editor, only the first occurrence of a term was highlighted in each of the segments. This has now been fixed.</li>
</ul>
