<p>The mobile app provides extensive search and filtering capabilities for users.</p>
<p>Linguist users can search and filter jobs in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the <em>Jobs </em>Dashboard, select the search icon in the top left-hand corner to search for a job by name.</li>
<li>To search for a job within a specific category (Overdue Jobs, New Jobs, etc.), select that category from the Dashboard and use the search bar.</li>
<li>To narrow the search, use the filtering options. You can filter by workflow step, target language, and project to find the job you are looking for. To do this, click on the category in the <em>Jobs D</em>ashboard. Select the three-line, "hamburger" button in the top left-hand corner, and sort by <em>Workflow, Target, </em>or <em>Project.</em>
</li>
</ul>
