<p><strong>Support for Term Level Metadata</strong></p>
<p>To allow more complex work with terminology in Memsource, we are making it possible for users to specify advanced metadata fields for each of the terms.</p>
<p>The following metadata are currently supported for new or already existing terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Part of Speech</li>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Number</li>
<li>Note</li>
<li>Short Translation</li>
<li>Term Type</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like to learn more, you will be able to find all the necessary information <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003681851" target="_self">in our documentation</a>. Please note the information will be published at the time of the release.</p>

<p><strong>Term Base Redesign</strong></p>
<p>In order to fully accommodate to the changes being introduced for term metadata, we have also redesigned the UI of the Term Bases to provide this information more easily.</p>
<p>The individual translations of your terms are now displayed in rows and columns have been rearranged to allow displaying of the various available term metadata.</p>
<p>You can also decide which languages are you interested in seeing as well as filter or show/hide respective metadata columns.</p>
