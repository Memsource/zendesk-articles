<ul>
<li>String names were not always aligned between the web and desktop Editors. These names now match each other and the names in <em>Project Settings</em><strong>.</strong>
</li>
<li>When using the <em>Find and Replace </em>feature to replace multiple terms, the first instance of the term was not always replaced. This issue has now been fixed.</li>
