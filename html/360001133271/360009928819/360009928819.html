<p><strong>Shortcuts for Em and En Dashes</strong></p>
<p>While users can still use Alt+0151 to create an em dash (—) or Alt+0150 for an en dash (–), users can also use keyboard shortcuts to create these dashes. Using CTRL+ALT+the minus sign will create an em dash, and using ALT+the minus sign will create an en dash.</p>

<p><strong>En Dashes and Em Dashes No Longer Count as Words</strong></p>
<p>In order to help users get a more accurate word count, em dashes and en dashes are now no longer counted as words.</p>
