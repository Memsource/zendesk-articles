<strong>Tip:</strong> You can create a new job directly from an email attachment or add a file from another app.</div>
<p>If you are using an iOS device, you can share the file with Memsource. On an Android device, you can open the file with the Memsource app.</p>
<p><img src="https://help.memsource.com/hc/article_attachments/360006500652/mceclip1.png" width="212" height="365">           <img src="https://help.memsource.com/hc/article_attachments/360006542631/mceclip3.png" width="212" height="365">  </p>

<p> </p>
<p>After you add a file, you can adjust the job settings. For example, if your project has multiple target languages, you can select which target languages are required for that job. You can then decide on the Linguists or Vendors for each of the chosen languages. The list of Linguists and Vendors that appears is based on the accounts associated with your organization’s account. </p>
<h2>Supported File Types</h2>
<p>The mobile app supports the following file types: </p>
<p>Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, HTML/XML, and plain text.</p>
<p>There are file import settings available for Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint files. They are the same as the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002825692-Creating-a-new-job#File_Import_Settings_1">settings in your Memsource account</a>. </p>
