<p>A new version of the Memsource Editor for Desktop has been released with general stability improvements.</p>
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Every segment with the same source was considered a repetition regardless of the Context key (if the job was imported with Context key). This has been fixed and only segments with the same source text and the same Context key are marked as repetition in the Editor.</li>
</ul>
