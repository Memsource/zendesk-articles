<ul>
<li>Due to a bug, when working with <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022358991-Bidirectional-Text" target="_self">RTL languages</a>, the cursor position and highlights would sometimes be shifted incorrectly to the right. This has now been resolved.</li>
<li>When viewing the <em>Changes </em>tab and then confirming a segment, the editor would sometimes switch to the <em>CAT </em>tab. This has been fixed.</li>
</ul>
