<p>Google Drive is a cloud-based file storage and synchronization service designed to integrate with most operating systems and devices, sync content in real-time across multiple devices, and act as a backup data repository for data.</p>
<p>Google Drive connector allows the downloading of source files and uploading of target files directly to/from the personal Google Drive repository. Shared drives are currently not supported. The connector uses the Google Drive API to implement the integration.</p>
<p>Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides use specialized file formats that Memsource does not support. The connector converts these file types to .docx, .xlsx, or .pptx, respectively, for processing. When a translation of any of those types of files is completed and uploaded back to Google Drive, they are automatically converted back into their native Google format.</p>
<p>Google Drive cannot export Google Docs files over a certain size (approximately 10 MB). The error <em>The file is too large to be exported </em>is triggered and the job will not be created. In this case, download the file and upload it to Memsource manually.</p>
<h2>Google Drive Connector Use Cases</h2>
<p>There are a number of use cases for the connector:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Managers can <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003483992" target="_self">add files directly to projects from an online repository</a>
</li>
<li>Set up the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003941812" target="_self">Automation Widget</a> allowing Submitters to add files to requests directly from the online repository.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003460931" target="_self">Automated Project Creation</a> (APC) to have Memsource automatically create new projects when a change in the <strong>last modified date</strong> is detected in monitored files or a folder.
<ul>
<li>Selected files are imported the very first time APC runs. All files are imported when a folder is monitored.</li>
<li>This connector supports absolute path setting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set up <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015039031" target="_self">Continous Jobs</a> to have Memsource monitor selected files for changes.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://cloud.memsource.com/web/docs/api#tag/Connector" target="_self">Connector API</a> can be used to automate steps otherwise performed manually through the UI. <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004209771" target="_self">Webhooks</a> can be used to have Memsource notify 3rd party systems about certain events (for example, a job status change).</li>
</ul>
