<p>When a segment is repeated in a document, it is called a repetition. If the file is imported with a Context key, the segment is considered a repetition only if the source text and the segment's context key are the same.</p>
<p>A repetition can easily be identified in Memsource Editor by blue arrows that are displayed next to the repeated segment. Segments with <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360031122932" target="_self">Plural Form</a> are not considered repetitions.</p>
<p>Once a user confirms a repeated segment, all the repeated instances of that segment below it will be updated with the confirmed translation. Please note that repetitions are only propagated downwards.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Disabling Auto-propagation of Repetitions</span></h2>
<p>There is an option to enable/disable the auto-propagation of repetitions either in the<em> Pre-translation</em> section of the general Memsource Setup or in the <em>Pre-translate</em> section of the Project Settings when creating a new project or editing an existing project. By default, this option is enabled. If disabled, the blue arrows next to repeated segments are greyed out. </p>
<p>In the <em>Access and Security</em> section of the general Memsource Setup, there is the option to decide whether Linguist users can choose to enable/disable the auto-propagation of repetitions from within the Editors. See the article on <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003460891-How-to-Be-Secure-with-Memsource-Cloud#Linguists_may_turn_on/turn_off_auto-propagation_of_repetitions">access and security settings</a> for more information.</p>
<p>In the Editors, the auto-propagation of repetitions option can be found by going to <strong>Tools, </strong>clicking on <strong>Preferences </strong>and selecting the <em>CAT </em>pane.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Segments with a different number will not be auto-propagated as they are not repetitions, but they should be marked as 100% matches from the TM, and the number should be automatically replaced. Unfortunately, this feature is not available for languages with no spaces between words (Japanese, Chinese, etc.). Also, it does not work in cases where there is a formatting difference in the segments.</p>

</h2>
<p>Sometimes it is necessary to introduce a <em>Repetition Exception</em>, which allows a repeated segment to have a different translation than all the other repeated segments. This can be done by clicking on the repetition icon, which will then become crossed out. This will ensure that any translation for this segment will not change in line with the other repetitions.</p>
