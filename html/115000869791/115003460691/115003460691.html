<p>Users can have more than one Memsource account as long as each account has a unique username. Translators can also work for several different agencies as their Linguists and can have their own Team Start edition account as well.</p>
<p><br>However, it is important to always use the relevant username and password, since only the correct username can access the specific jobs assigned under that username.</p>
<p><br> Sometimes, the best solution is to <font color="#333333">a single Team Start</font> account and act like a <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003461731-Roles-available-in-Memsource-Cloud#Vendor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vendor</a>. In this situation, you would simply ask the agency to <a href="http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">share the projects or jobs</a>.</p>
<p><br>Please note that you cannot use your Linguist account for translating jobs other than those assigned to you by a Project Manager.</p>
