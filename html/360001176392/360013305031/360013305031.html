<h2>New Features and Improvements</h2>
<p><strong>Support for In-context Preview for Multilingual XML files</strong></p>
<p>Like <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001501131-XML">monolingual XML files</a>, the multilingual XML format now also supports previews. Attach the appropriate XSLT template, which can generate an HTML preview (via the <em>Preview translation</em> option in the Editor) instead of the XML one. You can also use it as an in-context preview in the Editors.</p>
<p>You can find out more information in our <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001483592-Multilingual-XML">multilingual XML documentation</a>.</p>

<p><strong>New Sitecore Connector </strong></p>
<p>The Sitecore connector is the latest addition to our range of integrations and is available for our Enterprise users.</p>
<p>Sitecore is a customer experience management software that includes a content management system. The Memsource connector for Sitecore pulls web content from Sitecore folders into Memsource for translation. The translated files are then pushed back into Sitecore. This connector can also be used as part of the Automated Project Creation.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To learn more about how to set the connector up, please visit our Connectors documentation for <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003948452#Sitecore">Sitecore</a>.</span></p>

<p><strong>Marking Terms as Preferred</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When working with complicated terminology, several translations of a term can be available to the translator. It is now possible to mark terms as </span><strong>Preferred</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, indicating which of the available terms should be used in the translation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preferred terms will always be displayed on top of the list of terms in the CAT panel, or they can be identified by an additional remark in the </span><a href="http://take.ms/TkCFT"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suggestion details</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>See our <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003681851-Term-Bases#Term_Attributes_1">Term Base article</a> to learn more about term attributes like <em>Preferred</em>.</p>
