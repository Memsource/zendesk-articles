<p>Slow response time from Memsource or the web editor can be caused either by problems on the Memsource side or by your internet connection. If you are experiencing a slow response time, there are a few things you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check out our <a href="http://status.memsource.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Status page</a> to see if there are any incidents reported and to see the <em>Web App's Response Time</em>. If the response time is approximately 500 ms, Memsource is working correctly. If the response time is higher, please contact the Memsource Support team.<br> <img style="width: 344px; height: 264px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" src="https://help.memsource.com/hc/article_attachments/115004125592/import-731018.jpg" alt=""><br><br>
</li>
<li>You can also track the accessibility of Memsource servers across the world using Host Tracker. Open <a href="https://www.host-tracker.com/InstantCheck/3/ee0281d7-9874-e811-87c3-0003ff7328cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this link</a> and run a new <em>"Check"</em> to get the latest results.<br><img src="https://help.memsource.com/hc/article_attachments/360021333952/mceclip1.png"><br><br>
</li>
<li>In most cases, the problem is caused by your Internet Service Provider who could be re-routing your connection to the Memsource server via too many other servers, thus slowing the speed. If you are working with Windows, please <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/">download WinMTR</a>—an application for tracking connection routes. You can then generate a log and discuss it with your provider.</li>
