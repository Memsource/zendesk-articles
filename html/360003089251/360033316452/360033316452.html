<p><strong>Landscape View is Now Available</strong></p>
<p>It is now possible to edit segments in landscape view, making translating easier and more convenient.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The "Cancel" Button Has Been Replaced</strong></p>
<p>In order to streamline the look of our Mobile Editor, the <strong>Cancel </strong>button in the top right corner of the screen where segments are edited has been replaced by an <strong>X </strong>on iOS devices. This button will still function in the same way as the <strong>Cancel </strong>button had.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>T</strong><strong>erms Found in the Term Base are Now Highlighted</strong></p>
<p>In keeping with the Editor for Web and the Editor for Desktop, terms that are found in the TB will now be highlighted when looking at a segment. Note that this is only available for Android devices.</p>
