<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due Date Schemes allow users to configure a set of conditions which will be used to automatically calculate a Due Date for projects received via the Automation Widget or Automated Project Creation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To set up a due date, navigate to </span><strong>Setup</strong> and click on<strong> Due Date Schemes</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the <em>Automation </em>section<em>. </em>Either use the </span><strong>New</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> button to create a new Due Date Scheme, or click on an existing one to adjust it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><em>Name, Quota</em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><em>Office Hours</em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are mandatory fields that need to be filled in in order to create a Due Date Scheme.</span></p>
<h2>Quota</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><strong>Quota</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is used to determine the volume of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">characters, words</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">pages</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that can be processed within a given time period. The combination of these 2 factors is then used to calculate an </span>hourly rate<span style="font-weight: 400;"> for which documents can be translated (e.g. quota: 240 words per day, rate: 10 words per hour). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a document is submitted, its volume is used to calculate the approximate delivery time (e.g. it would take 5 hours to translate 50 words). The lowest threshold for each calculation is set to 2 hours which ensures that even small assignments do not create unreasonable delivery times (e.g. it would take 2 hours to translate a document with only 10 words, regardless of the calculated time).</span></p>
<h2>Working Days and Office Hours</h2>
<p><strong>Working days</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> determine what days you would be able to work on the assignments and so which days should be taken into account when calculating the Due Date. </span><strong>Non-business days</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be used to exclude specific days from the calculation (e.g. bank holidays, or a company-wide absence). </span></p>
<p><strong>Office hours</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are used to specify which hours of the given workday you would be able to work on the assignments. They are also used to specify the </span><strong>Start</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the calculation as well as the </span><strong>Delivery</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> times depending on when the calculated Due Date would fall.</span></p>
<h2>Start</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This rule allows you to determine the starting time of the calculation depending on whether the documents have been received during or after office hours. For both of these options, the calculation can start </span><strong>immediately</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a specific </span><strong>number of hours after submission,</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><strong>at a specific day and time.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, you can specify that the calculation for jobs received </span><strong>DURING</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> office hours would start immediately after the document is received. On the other hand, the calculation for jobs received </span><strong>AFTER</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> office hours should start at the beginning of the next working day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Note:</strong> The lowest threshold ensures that smaller assignments will always take at least 2 hours to deliver. Therefore, if there is a small job (e.g. 10 words) submitted later than 2 hours before the end of office hours, it will automatically be regarded as delivered </span><strong>AFTER</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> office hours. This ensures no small assignments will be delivered late only because they were delivered at the end of the office hours and so were not addressed in time.</span></p>
<h2>Delivery</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on the </span><strong>Quota, Office hours,</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><strong>Start</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> time, a Due Date is automatically calculated using an </span><strong>hourly rate</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which, depending on the size, will determine when jobs should be delivered. However, the calculated Due Date can fall both </span><strong>DURING</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><strong>AFTER</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> office hours and similarly </span><strong>DURING</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><strong>OUTSIDE</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of working days. The rules set in the </span><strong>Delivery</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> section specify how the deadline should be adjusted if the Due Date falls outside of the desired time ranges. You can also specify how the Due Date should be adjusted for jobs to be delivered within office hours. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If, for example, a job’s Due Date should fall on Wednesday, 18:00 (outside of office hours), you can determine that the job will not be delivered immediately (as calculated) or on a specific day and time (e.g. the next working day at 12:00). Similarly, if the job is calculated to be delivered at 13:00 (inside office hours), you can either choose to deliver it right at this time or at a specific later day and time (e.g. at 12:00 the next day).</span></p>
<h2>Large Assignments</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The automatically calculated Due Date can be extended by a certain amount of hours or days depending on the size of the received job. With the option </span><strong>If job is larger than…,</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the calculated Due Date can be automatically extended by the specified amount of time. </span></p>
