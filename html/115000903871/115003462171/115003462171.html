<p>In the Memsource Editor, users can add comments and create conversation threads about an entire segment (using a per-segment comment) or a section of a segment (using an in-line comment).</p>
<p>The purpose of the Conversation feature is to allow all users involved in the job (Linguists, Project Managers, Guests) to cooperate, even across workflow steps. A comment made in any step will be visible in all the other steps.</p>
<p>The conversations also include a Language Quality Assessment (LQA) feature which allows users to evaluate segments or a section of a segment based on the type of issue and its severity.</p>
<p>It is possible to add new comments, edit previous comments, or reply to comments. Any text that is typed into the comment boxes is cached, ensuring that the text is not lost if the window is accidentally closed before the comment is posted.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This feature is available only in the Memsource Editors (for Desktop and for Web) and only when the Editor is connected to the server.</li>
<li>The linguists can add comments to jobs that were set to Completed (unless the linguist was automatically deactivated).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Adding a Comment</h2>
<p>To start a conversation about a segment, click on the relevant segment. To add a comment about a particular section (an in-line comment), highlight that section instead.</p>
<p>Select the speech bubble icon next to the segment. (This will be a <strong>Q</strong> icon if the LQA feature is already enabled.) Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut <em>Ctrl+Shift+M.</em></p>
<h2>Adding a Reply</h2>
<p>Replies can be added to any comment that has already been posted. Replies are indented to makes it easier to navigate the conversation. It is not possible to add replies as in-line comments.</p>
<h2>Editing a Comment or Reply</h2>
<p>Comments and replies can be edited using the <strong>3-dot menu</strong> next to the date. This menu also includes the option to delete the comment or reply.</p>
<h2>Resolving Conversations</h2>
<p>Once the comments in a conversation have been addressed, the conversation should be marked as resolved. Conversations are part of the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003484052-Quality-Assurance">Quality Assurance</a> check, so if a conversation is left unresolved it will be displayed in the QA warnings when a QA check is run. In projects with workflow steps, comments are not only automatically pushed into higher steps (in a way similar to translations), but also to lower steps.</p>
<div class="alert alert-red">
<p><strong>Important:</strong> The Conversation feature is not available when working offline.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Connection to the Memsource server (via your user login) is required in order to display current conversations or to add a new conversation.</p>

<h1>Language Quality Assessments</h1>
<p>In addition to adding and editing comments, it is also possible to add Language Quality Assessment (LQA) evaluations (in projects with multiple workflow steps).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> LQA needs to be enabled by an Administrator for a specific workflow step in the main <strong>Setup </strong>page.</p>
<p><img style="width: 378px; height: 436px; float: right;" src="https://help.memsource.com/hc/article_attachments/115004127952/import-810102.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2>Adding an LQA</h2>
<p>As with comments in conversations, it is possible to add LQA feedback to the whole segment or to part of it. First, click on the conversation bubble (or <strong>Q</strong> icon if LQA is already enabled) in any of the higher workflow steps, and then click on <strong>Add LQA</strong>. For example, if your project contains Translation and Review steps, the <strong>Add LQA</strong> button will not be present in the Translation step. Then, choose the <strong>Type of warning</strong> and its <strong>Severity.</strong></p>
<p>The following LQA categories are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accuracy</li>
<li>Fluency</li>
<li>Terminology</li>
<li>Style</li>
<li>Design</li>
<li>Locale convention</li>
<li>Verity</li>
<li>Other</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these categories can then be set to various levels of severity: <strong>Neutral</strong>, <strong>Minor</strong>, <strong>Major</strong>, <strong>Critical</strong>.</p>
<h2>Editing LQA</h2>
<p>Similar to comments, <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003632531-Language-Quality-Assessment">Language Quality Assessments</a> (LQA) evaluations can be edited or deleted through the <strong>3-dot menu.</strong></p>
<h2>Replying to LQA</h2>
<p>As with the comments, it is possible to react to the LQA evaluation using the <strong>Reply</strong> button. The reply will also be indented to make it easier to read the conversation.</p>
