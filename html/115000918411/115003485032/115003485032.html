<li>
<strong>Get file by name</strong><br> Unfortunately this is not possible - the file can be uploaded to several worksteps so it would be impossible to identify the right one. Only jobPart is supported in GetJob API.<br>  </li>
<li>

<li>
<strong>API for deleting multiple domains</strong><br> This API is not available.<br>  </li>
<li>
<strong>Assign linguist to multiple task in one call</strong><br> not available. You have to call each task in EditJob API individually.<br>  </li>
<li>
<strong>File size limit in createJob</strong><br> File size limit for API is the same as for Cloud: 1GB per file or 200MB for zip.<br>  </li>
