<ul>
<li>Due to a bug, when a user selected all QA warnings and tried to mark them as ignored, they would be logged off. This has now been resolved.</li>
<li>Previously, user IDs would only occasionally be displayed in the <em>CAT </em>Pane.  This has now been corrected so that it is possible to have them displayed at all times.</li>
