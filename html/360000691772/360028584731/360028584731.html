<p>Microsoft Azure is the part of Azure Storage that can be integrated with Memsource. It is a cloud-based platform that provides serverless containers to help you build, manage, and deploy applications. Below, you’ll find instructions on how to integrate your Azure account with Memsource.</p>
<h2>Setting up the Connector</h2>
<p>Before setting up the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003948452-Connectors">connector</a> in Memsource, log in to your Microsoft Azure account through the <a href="http://portal.azure.com/">Azure portal</a>. Click on <strong>Storage accounts </strong>in the left-hand navigation panel. Select an existing storage account or create a new one. In the <em>Settings</em> menu, click <strong>Access keys</strong> and copy either key 1 or key 2. You’ll need this later in Memsource.</p>
<p>Once you have the key copied, go to Memsource. Navigate to Setup and scroll down to the <em>Integrations </em>section. Click on <strong>Connectors.</strong> After clicking on <strong>New</strong>, you can choose the connector you wish to create. Give it a name and change the Type to <em>Microsoft Azure.</em></p>

<h3>Getting your Connection String</h3>
<p>The final field you’ll need to fill out is the <em>Connection String </em>field. This will be one long string with the key you copied from Microsoft Azure in the middle. Replace the ✱ in the following string with that key:</p>
<p>DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=memsourceconnector;AccountKey=✱==;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net</p>
<p>Then, paste the entire string into the <em>Connection string</em> field. Click on <strong>Test Connection. </strong>If you’ve done everything correctly, a little check mark will appear next to the <strong>Test Connection </strong>button. Click <strong>Save.</strong></p>
