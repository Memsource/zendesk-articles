<p>We continuously work hard to improve the Editor to minimize the number of crashes. However, the unfortunate fact is that every application can crash once in a while.</p>
<p> If MemSource Editor does crash, it can usually be relaunched and the translation document gets automatically restored without any major data loss. If you still experience difficulties, please check the solutions below.</p>
<h2><span id="Editor_Crashes_and_Cannot_Be_Relaunched" class="mw-headline">The Editor Crashes and Cannot Be Relaunched</span></h2>
<p>If for any reason MemSource Editor cannot be relaunched (the user gets an error message when opening the Editor), please try the following:</p>
<p>For Windows Vista and Windows 7:</p>
<ol>
<li>Manually delete the <tt>.memsource</tt> directory located in <tt>C:\Users\[your user name]\</tt>
</li>
<li>Relaunch the Editor</li>
</ol>
<p>For Windows Windows XP:</p>
<ol>
<li>Manually delete the <tt>.memsource</tt> directory located in <tt>C:\Documents and Settings\[your user name]\</tt>
</li>
<li>Relaunch the Editor</li>
</ol>

<p>To prevent any data loss during a crash, the Editor has a built-in autosave feature which should restore the document you were working on. If, for any reason, the file you were editing does not get restored, take these steps to restore it manually:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the MXLIFF file again from your project in MemSource—assuming you were not working offline, the MXLIFF file should always include the latest version of all segments you confirmed.</li>
<li>Should this fail, try to pre-translate your MXLIFF file from the translation memory in your project, via the <strong>Pre-translate</strong> button.</li>
<li>If the Editor still crashes when opening the file, try renaming the MXLIFF file.</li>
</ol>
