<p><strong>Preserving Layout Changes</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has been possible for users to change the position of the different windows in the Memsource Desktop Editor for a while, but previously when the Editor was closed, the windows were restored to their default position. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the latest release of the Desktop Editor, any changes to the layout of the windows will be saved and re-applied when the user opens the Desktop Editor again. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The default layout can be restored by using the </span><strong>Restore Default Layout </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">option in the Tools menu, as shown below:</span></p>

<p><strong>Support for Bi-directional Texts</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the </span><a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006839432-July-10-2018-Web-Editor-Release-v6-121"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web Editor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Desktop Editor now also allows users to insert marks in target segments where the direction of the text changes from right-to-left to left-to-right and vice versa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Included with this feature is improved support for bi-directional texts in our in-context preview; when switching between source and target languages in the in-context preview, the text direction of the preview will also be switched.</span></p>
