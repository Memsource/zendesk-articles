<p>The Memsource Freelancer edition is intended for <a href="https://www.memsource.com/en/freelance-translators"><span style="color: #333333;">Freelance translators</span></a> or smaller teams of translators who want to collaborate more closely and have a joint account. More information can be found on <a href="http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Memsource_Editions#1.2B_Freelancers_Edition">our dedicated page</a>. </p>
<h2>Freelancer Edition Limitations</h2>
<p>Unlike the Personal edition, the Freelancer edition does not have any limitation in terms of the number of files or the file size of each job that can be uploaded. (The only exceptions for this come from the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003483412-Memsource-Limits">general limitations of the system</a>.)</p>
<h2>Users in the Freelancer Edition</h2>
<p>The 1+Freelancer edition includes only Administrator/Project Manager users. (This is different from higher editions, which include Linguist users as well).<br>If a single translator is using the 1+Freelancer edition, this user is the Administrator of the account. If there are multiple translators are collaborating in a single 1+Freelancer account, one of them will always need to be designated as the Administrator. The rest will be Project Managers.</p>
<h2>Payments</h2>
<p>As with other editions, the Administrator in the 1+Freelancer edition is the person responsible for payments. If the collaborating translators want to split the payments, the easiest way is to take turns in paying for the subscription.</p>
<h2>Upgrading and Downgrading</h2>
<p>If there ever comes a time when you feel like the 1+Freelancer edition is longer meeting your needs, you can choose to upgrade, downgrade, or to change the number of users in your account.</p>
<h3>Upgrading</h3>
<p>To upgrade or to increase the number of users, you only need to use <strong>Setup - Subscription - Details. </strong></p>
<h3><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">Downgrading</span></h3>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Please make sure you comply with the above-mentioned storage limitations. Once you downgrade your account, additional data exceeding these limits will be deleted</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">You have two options for downgrading your 1+Freelancer account back to a Personal edition:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Contact <a href="mailto:support@memsource.com">Memsource Support</a> so that they can downgrade your edition for you. </li>
<li>Allow your 1+Freelancer/Team Start edition account to expire, exporting all the relevant data if needed. Once you do this, create a new Personal edition account. You can re-subscribe to the expired account at any time, but please keep our <a href="http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Data_Storage">data storage </a>policy in mind to avoid any loss of data.</li>
