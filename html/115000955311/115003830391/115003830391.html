<h2><span id="Introduction" class="mw-headline">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>The privacy and security of user's data in Memsource is our utmost priority. Traditionally, data, including confidential information, such as translations, translation memory files, terminology, etc. have been transmitted by email (mostly unencrypted) in the translation industry. We believe that centralizing confidential data in a single location, such as Memsource, and only providing password-protected access to it, is a step forward in data security for the translation industry.</p>
<h2><span id="Certifications" class="mw-headline">Certifications</span></h2>
<p>Memsource has been <a class="external text" href="http://static.memsource.com/files/Memsource-ISO-27001-Certification-2017-2020.pdf" rel="nofollow">certified for ISO 27001</a> which proves that the information security management system which we have introduced conforms to the ISO standard. The Memsource application has also been audited by an independent security consultancy following the OWASP ASVS standard.</p>
<p>The ISO certificate was renewed for years 2017-2020.</p>
