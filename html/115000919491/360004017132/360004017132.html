<p><span style="font-weight:400">With the Memsource Mobile App, you can connect to your Memsource account on the go from your smartphone or tablet.</span></p>
<h2>Downloading the Mobile App</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">The mobile app can be downloaded for free from both </span><span style="font-weight:400">Google Play</span><span style="font-weight:400"> (Android) and the </span><span style="font-weight:400">App Store</span><span style="font-weight:400"> (iOS).</span></p>
<h2>Logging In</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">When you open the app for the first time, you will be asked to log in. Enter your Memsource username and password, or sign in with Google (if this is how you signed up for Memsource). </span></p>

<h2>Manage Multiple Accounts</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">You can add multiple Memsource accounts to the mobile app and seamlessly move between them from the <em>User Account</em> page.</span></p>
<p>S<span style="font-weight:400">elect your profile picture/name at the top of your screen. Select <strong>Add Account</strong>, or choose another account to switch to it.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">It doesn’t matter if you have multiple Linguist accounts, multiple Project Manager accounts, or a mixture of the two—they can all be added. You can add a maximum of 5 different accounts, but the app only supports Project Manager and Linguist user accounts.  </span></p>
<h2>Notifications</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">If you're a Linguist user, our notification service will alert you when you are assigned to a job. As a Project Manager, it will alert you when </span><span style="font-weight:400">a job status has changed in a project you are managing or a job you are assigned to. You will receive a notification directly to your mobile phone or tablet, similar to the one below. When you select this notification, you will be taken directly to the mobile app. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400">If you want to make other changes to your profile (such as changing your password, etc.) this has to be done within the main Memsource page.</span></p>
