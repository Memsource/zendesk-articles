<p>This article will discuss the Compare Analysis feature. For more general analysis information, please see our main <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002826872">Analysis</a> article.</p>
<p>The Compare Analysis feature is available only in projects with <a class="mw-redirect" title="MemSource Cloud User Manual" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003484032-Workflow">Workflow steps</a> (Available in the Team, Ultimate and Enterprise editions only). This type of analysis makes it possible to compare two versions of a file in different Workflow steps and analyze to what extent the two versions differ. For example, comparing the Translation and Review steps gives the actual effort of the Reviewer (that is, how much the translation changed in the Review step). </p>
