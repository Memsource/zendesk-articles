<h2>Entering into the Agreement and Your Acknowledgement</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Agreement is entered into once You accept these Terms of Service and You initiate Your Memsource Subscription.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You acknowledge that these Terms of Service are binding for Your use of Memsource. By using Memsource, You express Your full understanding and agreement to these Terms of Service. All copyright and/or know-how and/or any other intellectual property rights in relation to Memsource shall become and remain Our sole and exclusive property and You shall have no claim to it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You acknowledge that We reserve the right to amend these Terms of Service from time to time but such amendments will not apply retroactively. We will notify You of the proposed wording of the amended Terms of Service (or only those of its clauses which are subject to amendment) at least 1 month prior to the effective date of the proposed amendment. If You do not agree to the proposed amendment of these Terms of Service, You have the right to terminate the Agreement as of the day immediately preceding the effective date of the proposed amendment by sending a cancellation notice to Us. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If You do not cancel the Agreement in accordance with the previous paragraph, the amended Terms of Service will become a part of the Agreement and you will be bound by these Terms of Service as of the effective date of the proposed amendment.</span></p>
<h2>Memsource Subscription Fee</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon Your payment of a subscription fee to Us or when using a free version of Memsource, We grant You and Your Affiliates a personal, non-exclusive, time-limited, non-transferable and revocable license to use Memsource, for as long as You comply with these Terms of Service. All rights not expressly granted in these Terms of Service are reserved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You acknowledge that You are fully responsible for timely payment of all subscription fees for Memsource in line with Your subscription plan. If You fail to pay any subscription fee or any other amount payable to Us on its due date, We have the right to terminate Your account and the Agreement with immediate effect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is Your responsibility to comply with any obligations to pay any taxes and charges, arising from Your subscription to Memsource, in addition to the subscription fee, should You become subject to such obligations in Your home country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If You are a natural person residing in Japan (and You are not a legal entity or a natural person—entrepreneur), You are not allowed to purchase any of Our paid subscription plans.</span></p>
<h2>Your Responsibilities</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You acknowledge that You are fully responsible for Your use of Memsource, including responsibility for compliance with all laws and regulations that are applicable to You or the content You use in connection with Memsource. You may not use Memsource in any unlawful manner or in any other manner that could damage, disable, or interfere with or reverse engineer Memsource. We may, at Our sole discretion, adopt rules for permitted and appropriate use of Memsource and may update them from time to time. These rules shall form an inseparable part of these Terms of Service and shall be available on Our website. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate the provision of Our services immediately to any User whose activity disrupts or causes harm to Memsource infrastructure, or violates these Terms of Service, including the obligation to pay a subscription fee in line with the User’s subscription plan. We also reserve the right to suspend or terminate the provision of Our services immediately to any User who is not Your employee or Your contractor.</span></p>
<h2>Fair Use Policy</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Fair Use Policy applies to You only if Your subscription is based on per-User pricing, such as the Team Start, Team, and Ultimate subscription plans. We typically do not limit the number of words that You upload to Memsource in these subscription plans and expect that Your use will be fair. For the purpose of these Terms of Service, Your use of Memsource is fair if it does not exceed the fair use allowance. The fair use allowance is a word volume calculated in the following way: 100 words for each EUR (one euro) of Your subscription fee. Words are counted as source words in newly created jobs times the number of target languages. Words are counted towards the “word volume” only once—when a job is created. The job can then be analyzed, translated, and otherwise processed any number of times by any number of users without any impact on the word volume.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should Your word volume exceed the volume defined as fair use in any three-month period by more than 20%, We have the right to initiate a re-negotiation of the subscription terms with You. If no agreement is reached between You and Us within 30 days, We may terminate Your account and the Agreement with a 30-day notice period during which You may use Your account in line with these Terms of Service and respecting the fair use policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Example: If Your monthly subscription fee is EUR 500, then Your monthly fair use allowance is 50,000 words monthly. If You exceed such volume in any given 3-month period by 20%, i.e. would reach 180,000 source words or more in newly created jobs, then We may notify You and initiate re-negotiation of Your subscription terms.</span></p>
<h2>User Access</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Memsource services are subject to usage limits. Unless otherwise specified, Memsource may not be accessed by more than the number of purchased Users; a User’s password may not be shared with any other individual, and User identification may be reassigned to a new individual only if it replaces another User who no longer requires ongoing use of the Memsource service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You shall not sublicense or allow third parties individual user access to Memsource service, with the exception of Your employees and contractors who are using Memsource on Your behalf.</span></p>
<h2>Liability</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Memsource and the related documentation are provided by Us “as is” on a commercially reasonable basis and without warranties of any kind either expressed or implied. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although We strive to provide quality services to You and will use reasonable efforts to provide the functionality of Memsource, We do not provide any warranty that Memsource will be error-free and uninterrupted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not provide any warranty that Memsource Output (incl. translation memory, pre-translated, machine-translated or otherwise translated documents) will be error-free and correct. You are solely responsible for the final correction of Memsource Output and its use. We are not liable for any damage, whether direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential, including but not limited to, damage consisting in loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if We have been advised of the possibility of such damages) arising out of or in connection with Your use of Memsource, which has not been caused wilfully or by gross negligence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You acknowledge that We do not warrant that the use of Memsource will be error-free and uninterrupted. We, therefore, assume no liability for temporary non-operability or impaired accessibility of Memsource due to, but without limitation to, technical difficulties, dependence on the services of third parties and other reasons out of the scope of Our control. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although We periodically back up data in Memsource, You are solely responsible for creating backup copies of any of Your Content that You submit to Memsource.</span></p>
