<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create a PM account for each of your students by selecting <strong>Users</strong> and clicking <strong>New.</strong><em> </em>If you want your students to create passwords themselves, do not fill in the password fields and use the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003680631-User-Management#Email_Login">Email Login</a> function instead. You can also import a list of students from an Excel file using the </span><a href="https://www.memsource.com/blog/2016/12/20/batch-import-of-users/"><span style="color: #000000;">Batch Import</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> feature. </span><br><span style="color: #000000;"><br><img src="https://help.memsource.com/hc/article_attachments/360027784051/A1.png" alt="A1.png" width="653" height="321"><br></span>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"> </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to the <em>Editing</em> window of each account (under <strong>Users,</strong> choose the name of the student and then click <strong>Edit</strong>). S</span><span style="color: #000000;">elect the values in accordance with this </span><a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/article_attachments/360027784791/A2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">picture</a><span style="color: #000000;">.

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #000000;"><br></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Inform your students of their login details.</span>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #000000;"><br></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Have your students create their own projects by going to <strong>Create</strong> <strong>New</strong> and selecting <strong>Project.</strong> They can change the settings using </span><a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003680771-Projects#Project_Settings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this guide</a><span style="color: #000000;">, but it is recommended that they do not. For easier orientation, we suggest that students name these projects using the following format: “Project [Student’s Name]”. These projects will be your students’ personal folders.</span>

<div style="text-align: justify;"> </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"> </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Step 6:</strong> Have your students attach their TMs and TBs</span><span style="color: #000000;"> to the projects they have created by selecting their project, scrolling down to either <em>Translation Memories </em>or <em>Term Bases</em> and clicking <strong>Select. </strong></span><span style="color: #000000;">Once this is done, the preparations are complete.</span>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"> </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<strong><span style="color: #000000;">Step 7: </span></strong>Once you have the assignment for your students, you can easily <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/article_attachments/360027794912/A7.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create a job</a> for each of them inside their project by going to the <em>Projects</em> section and choosing their project. In the <em>Jobs </em>section, select  <strong>New. </strong>Unfortunately, these have to be created one-by-one. However, you can also send the file to your students via e-mail and they can create the projects themselves. You don't have to change the <em>File Import Settings</em>, but more advanced users can do so using <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003691852-Jobs#File_Import_Settings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this guide</a>.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"> </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Step 8: </strong>As the Administrator, you will be able to monitor your students’ progress. Once they've finished their assignment, they should simply <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003694592-How-to-Get-Started#Complete_a_Translation_in_Memsource_Cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">change the status</a> of the job to <em>Completed by Linguist. </em>This is done by going to their project, clicking the checkmark next to their job, selecting <strong>Change Status,</strong> and changing the status to <em>Completed by Linguist</em>.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"> </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Step 9:</strong> You can now <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003691852-Jobs#Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download the finished files</a> from your students’ projects by selecting their job and clicking on <strong>Download.</strong> </div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"> </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #000000;">There are a few things to note when using Approach A:</span> </div>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #000000;">Students MUST </span>create their own projects, TMs, and TBs because they will only be able to see what they've created themselves.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Students CANNOT have a shared TM or TB because only the first student to finish the task would actually have to translate it. Everybody else would have those translations suggested automatically and would not have to do anything.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">You can add as many Jobs to a project as you want. With every job, students’ TMs and TBs will grow and they will be able to benefit from what they have translated earlier. They will not be able to benefit, however, from what their classmates have translated.</li>
</ul>

For easier orientation, we suggest these projects be named using the following format: “Project [Student’s Name]”. These projects will be your students’ personal folders.

<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Step 4: </strong>Attach the students’ TMs and TBs to the corresponding projects you have created (for example, Peter’s TM and TB to Peter’s Project). You can do this by selecting your student's project, clicking on either <strong>Translation</strong> <strong>Memories</strong> or <strong>Term</strong> <strong>Bases</strong> and then <strong>Select.</strong><em> </em>Once this is done, the preparations </span>are now complete.<br><br></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Step 5: </strong>Once you have an assignment for your students, you can easily </span><a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/article_attachments/360027794912/A7.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create a job</a><span style="color: #000000;"> for each of them inside their project by selecting their project and selecting <strong>New </strong>in the <em>Jobs </em>section.

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em><br></em></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Step 7: </strong>You can now <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003691852-Jobs#Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download the finished files</a> from your students’ projects by selecting their job and clicking on <strong>Download.</strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><em><br><br></em></span></p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #000000;">There are a few things to note when using this approach:</span> </div>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Students CANNOT have a shared TM or TB because only the first student to finish the task would actually have to translate it. Everybody else would have those translations suggested automatically and would not have to do anything. They also CANNOT have a shared project, because only one of them would be able to accept the job.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You can add as many jobs to a project as you want. With every job, students’ TMs and TBs will grow so they will be able to benefit from what they have translated earlier. They will not, however, be able to benefit from what their classmates have translated.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #000000;">For the repetitive creation of accounts, projects, TMs, and TBs, macro recording software like</span> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANwBNYv3gC8-watch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TinyTask</a><span style="color: #000000;"> can be very helpful.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>General tip for advanced users</strong>:</span><span style="color: #000000;"> If you have more lecturers in your translation department and want them to only manage their own groups of students, you can create a PM account for each of them with the settings described in point 2 of Approach A. After this, they can create their own groups of accounts using Approach A or B inside their own PM accounts. In this case, Approach B is recommended. If they opt for Approach A, the account administrator will have to give them the right to <em>View projects created by other users</em>, i. e. their students. This is done by going to the <em>Users </em>section. Select the checkmark next to the lecturers' names and click <strong>Edit. </strong>Under the <em>Projects </em>section, make sure that <strong>View projects created by other users </strong>is selected.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">
<a style="font-weight: bolder; text-align: justify; font-size: 13px;" name="_C)"></a>Approach C<a style="font-weight: bolder; font-size: 13px;" name="ApproachC"></a><a style="font-weight: bolder; font-size: 13px;" name="_C)"></a>
</h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>For advanced users:</strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><br>This approach is unusual because it does not follow the common educational setup. On the other hand, it allows you to create a realistic environment that closely resembles the hierarchy of real translation agencies.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Step 1: </strong></span><a href="https://cloud.memsource.com/"><span style="color: #000080;">Log into your account</span></a>.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Step 2: </strong></span>Create Project Manager accounts for those you want to manage projects. These can be either lecturers or students that are already familiar with the basic functionality of Memsource. (To create more separated “departments” within your license, you can use the <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003461551-Business-Units"><span style="color: #000080;">Business Units</span></a> feature. This way, some Projects, TMs, and TBs can be made visible only to users within the selected Business Unit.)</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Step 3: </strong></span> Using the <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003484032-Workflow"><span style="color: #000080;">Workflow</span></a> feature, create different steps of the translation process that will fit your needs. Translation, Revision, and Client Revision are the standard steps. If you do not want to have more steps in your translation process, skip this step.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: </strong>You or the Project Managers create user accounts for translators, reviewers, etc. One user can have all the roles at the same time, and both students and lecturers can have these roles.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The preparations are now complete. From now on, your license can work as a simulated agency. You or the Project Managers can create <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003680771-Projects"><span style="color: #000080;">projects</span></a>, <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003692212-Translation-Memories"><span style="color: #000080;">TMs</span></a>, and <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003681851-Term-Bases"><span style="color: #000080;">TBs</span></a> that can be assigned to the appropriate users—translators, reviewers, etc. Once you or the Project Managers upload and assign a <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003691852-Jobs"><span style="color: #000080;">job</span></a> to be done (one or more files to be translated), the whole translation process will launch automatically. Users will be notified by e-mail that there is work to be done once it's available. (For example, the reviewers will only be notified once the translation is finished and is ready for revision.)</p>
<p><br> <span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Tips</strong>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"> You can work with any language pair that your colleagues and students speak. For example, if you have pairs of students that speak the same foreign language, you can make them a translator–reviewer pair and let different pairs translate the same source text to various target languages.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Why not swap the roles sometimes? The accounts you create do not have to be assigned to specific names—you can let your students try different roles.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Use the deadlines to let your students know when their assignment should be finished.</span></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>There are some things you should keep in mind when using this approach:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is highly recommended that the same text is not translated more than once in the same language combination. This is because it will already be saved in the TM and no translation will have to be done the second time.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">You as an Administrator will be able to monitor all the processes that will be going on within the license.</span></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Lecturers from the Maastricht School of Translation and Interpreting have founded a network of such simulated agencies. Should this be of interest to you, feel free to visit </span><a href="http://www.instb.eu/"><span style="color: #000080;">their website</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Special thanks to Mr. Joop Bindels from the Maastricht School of Translation and Interpreting and Ms. Maria Fernandez Parra from the Swansea University for sharing the details of how they set up these simulated agencies.</span> </p>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>A common problem you may run into is the fact that the Linguist account does not offer the full interface. If you want your students to be able to learn how to create projects, TMs, and TBs, you should create PM accounts for them instead. Don't create free Personal edition licenses for your students because then they will be unable to benefit from all of the features. Using the Personal edition, they would also be unable to store their past projects.</p>
