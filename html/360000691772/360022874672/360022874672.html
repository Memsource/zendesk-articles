<p>Dropbox is a cloud-based file storage and synchronization service designed to integrate with most operating systems and devices, sync content in real-time across multiple devices, and act as a backup data repository for data.</p>
<p>Dropbox connector allows the downloading of source files and uploading of target files directly to/from the Dropbox repository. The connector uses the Dropbox API to implement the integration.</p>
<h2>Dropbox Connector Use Cases</h2>
<p>There are a number of use cases for the connector:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li>Project Managers can <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003483992" target="_self">add files directly to projects from an online repository</a>
</li>
<li>Set up the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003941812" target="_self">Automation Widget</a> allowing Submitters to add files to requests directly from the online repository.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003460931" target="_self">Automated Project Creation</a> (APC) to have Memsource automatically create new projects when a change in the <strong>last modified date</strong> is detected in monitored files or a folder.
<ul>
<li>Selected files are imported the very first time APC runs. All files are imported when a folder is monitored.</li>
<li>This connector supports absolute path setting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set up <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015039031" target="_self">Continous Jobs</a> to have Memsource monitor selected files for changes.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://cloud.memsource.com/web/docs/api#tag/Connector" target="_self">Connector API</a> can be used to automate steps otherwise performed manually through the UI. <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004209771" target="_self">Webhooks</a> can be used to have Memsource notify 3rd party systems about certain events (for example, a job status change).</li>
</ul>
