<p>A translation memory is a key aspect of every CAT tool. If you are not familiar with the translation memory concept, please read our <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003692212">Translation Memory</a> article first.</p>
<p>There are three ways to create a translation memory in Memsource:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first way to create a TM is directly from the <strong>panel menu</strong>. Click the <strong>plus (+)</strong> icon next to <em>Translation Memories </em>on the left side of the screen.<br> <img class="img250" title="Create TM from the left menu" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/dokdqv5yiy13hz5/TM_createLeftPane.png?raw=1" alt="TM_createLeftPane.png">
</li>
<li>You can also create a new TM directly from the <em>Translation Memories</em> page. Do this by clicking on the words <em>Translation Memories</em> on the left side of the screen and clicking <strong>New</strong> at the top of the next page.<br> <img class="img350" title="Create TM from the TM page" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qea7j5pnkhwrycs/TM_New_button.png?raw=1" alt="TM_New_button.png">
</li>
<li>The third way to create a TM is directly from the project itself. To do this, open the project, scroll down to the <em>Translation Memories </em>section, and click on <strong>Create New</strong><em>. </em>Using this method, the project's languages will be pre-selected in the new TM window, and the TM will be automatically assigned to that project.<br> <img class="img350" title="Create TM from the project page" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/hk24kp850l87mmy/TM_create_in_project.png?raw=1" alt="TM_create_in_project.png">
</li>
</ol>
<p>Using any of the methods above will open the <em>New Translation Memory</em> page. Here, you will fill out the following mandatory fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Name</em>
<ul>
<li>Give your new translation memory a name. Remember that you will be able to use it for other projects later on as well, so it does not have to be specific to just one project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<em>Source Language</em>
<ul>
<li>The source language is the original language of your document. Only one source language can be selected per translation memory. If you used method 3 as noted above, this will already be filled out for you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<em>Target Language</em>
<ul>
<li>A target language is a language that you will be translating into. There can be an unlimited number of target languages in a translation memory. Again, if you used method 3, this will already be filled out. <br>Please note that while a TM can have multiple languages, a maximum of 10-15 languages is recommended. Less than 30 languages are still manageable, but more than 50 languages will cause the TM to become very slow and very hard to work with.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also fill out the following fields as needed (if applicable):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Client</em></li>
<li><em>Business Unit</em></li>
<li><em>Domain</em></li>
<li><em>Subdomain</em></li>
<li><em>Note</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Click <strong>Create, </strong>and your translation memory is now complete.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011103391-Import-content-to-Translation-Memory">import</a> a TMX from another CAT tool (or a special Excel file) into your Memsource TM. You can also <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003483672-Align-documents-to-create-Translation-Memory">align</a> previously translated text with its original version and import it into your Memsource TM.</p>
<p>If you haven't done so already, don't forget to <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360014635732-Assign-Translation-Memory-to-a-project">assign</a> this memory to a Memsource project.</p>
