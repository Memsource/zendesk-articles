<p><strong>Preferred Terms Displayed First</strong></p>
<p>A preferred target term for a source term will be positioned above any other term associated with that source term in the <em>CAT</em> Pane.</p>
<p>This builds on the <a href="https://www.memsource.com/blog/2018/08/21/mark-terms-as-preferred-in-memsource-cloud-and-the-editors/">Preferred Terms feature</a> released a couple of weeks ago that allows terms to be marked as <em>Preferred</em>. </p>

<p><strong>Selecting All Before/After the Cursor</strong></p>
<p>The list of supported commands and keyboard shortcuts for the web editor has been extended. It is now possible to select everything before or after the cursor.</p>
<p>Windows/Linux users can use <em>CTRL+SHIFT+HOME/END</em> to jump to the beginning or end of the text after the cursor. Mac users can use <em>CMD+SHIFT+UP/DOWN</em> arrows to achieve the same result.</p>
