<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Please see our main article about <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002826872">Analysis</a> for general information.</p>
<p>The post-editing analysis show the "editing effort" - how much the linguist or the proofreader had to edit the text. When a linguist clicks on an untranslated segment, the current highest translation memory match, machine translation, and/or non-translatable match gets saved for that segment and is later used to calculate the post-editing analysis. For the Review post-editing analysis (in projects with workflow), the results are calculated as a difference between the translator's text and the proofreader's text.</p>
<p>The post-editing analysis is based on the target. Therefore, it must be launched after the post-editing job has been completed.</p>
<p>The post-editing analysis in Memsource extends the traditional translation memory analysis to also include machine translation (MT) and non-translatables (NT).</p>
<p>To run an analysis, open the project, select one or multiple jobs and click on the <strong>Analyze</strong> button. You will see the following options:</p>

<h2><span id="Translation_Memory_Analysis" class="mw-headline">Analyze TM Post-editing <br></span></h2>
<p>The <strong>Analyze TM post-editing </strong>option is used for calculating the post-editing effort for matches from the translation memory (TM).</p>
<h3>Doing Analysis with <strong>Analyze TM post-editing</strong> enabled:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Is intended for a low-quality TM that can contain high percent matches that need to be heavily edited by the Linguist.</li>
<li>Will show the post-editing effort for the translation memory.</li>
<li>Contains only 100% matches in the analysis (in-context 101% matches from the TM have no effect on the calculation).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A 100% match from the TM can become 0% if completely edited by the Linguist. Any match from the TM can become a 100% match if accepted by the Linguist without any change.</p>

<h3>Analysis with <strong>Analyze TM post-editing</strong> disabled:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Is intended for a high-quality TM where the matches should be edited as little as possible to keep the cost low.</li>
<li>Will show both 101% and 100% (similar to the Default Analysis).</li>
<li>Shows TM matches offered to the Linguist when the segment opened (not the actual Linguist's post-editing effort)</li>
<li>Will show the post-editing effort for machine translation and non-translatables.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Machine Translation and Non-translatables</h2>
<p>Similar to the <strong>Analyze TM post-editing</strong> settings, there are options to <strong>Analyze NT post-editing</strong> and to <strong>Analyze MT post-editing</strong>. Based on these settings, the MT and NT results can show the post-editing effort for each segment, reflecting the changes made by the Linguist when compared to the MT and NT suggestions. </p>
<ul>
<li>
If the MT or NT suggestion was accepted without further editing (the Linguist did not need to change it at all), it would come up as a 100% match in the analysis. 
</li>
<li>If, on the other hand, the Linguist changes the MT, the match rate will be lower. The score-counting algorithm is identical to the one that we use to calculate the score of translation memory fuzzy matches.</li>
<li>For NTs, any editing will cause the segment in question to become 0-49% NT.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this option is disabled, the editing effort of the Linguist will not be calculated and the analysis result will be similar to default analysis results:</p>
<ul>
<li>The entries from MT/NT without any estimated score will be in <strong>TM 0%-49%</strong> match. (These will be shown as fully translated by the Linguist; the MT is completely ignored.)</li>
<li>
<em>MTQE</em> and <em>Memsource translated</em> matches higher than 75% will be in the <strong>MT</strong> column in their respective matches.</li>
</ul>
