<p>Data that you upload to Memsource is completely private. It is only reserved for you and your organization's users which you create and allow to have access to the data.

<p>Memsource’s approach to customer data is fully compliant with governmental regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. Memsource will only interact with customer data if having an explicit customer consent for data processing. We will not use your content for any purpose other than to keep you <span class="emphasis"><em>informed</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>provide</em></span> you with Memsource services and <span class="emphasis"><em>enhance</em></span> our services and product offerings.</p>

</li>
</ul></div>
<p>Memsource uses data for training the artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to provide better service to our customers. Use of data by the AI team is guided by the following principles:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="bold bold"><strong>Full GDPR compliance</strong></span></p>
<p>All aspects of Memsource machine learning - from data training to implementation - is fully GDPR and CCPA compliant. Memsource treats all training data as potentially including personal data. Therefore, any training data is discarded within 90 days in line with GDPR guidelines.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="bold bold"><strong>Internal use only</strong></span></p>
<p>Memsource provides AI-powered features to Memsource customers and does not sell them to third-parties.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="bold bold"><strong>No training data reconstruction</strong></span></p>
<p>We use aggregate data to train machine learning models that do not output text. The output is metadata such as an MTQE score (50%, 75%, 100%). This approach rules out the possibility of data leak through the AI models and also prevents training data reconstruction.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="bold bold"><strong>No mingling of customer data for features that output text</strong></span></p>
<p>For any AI features that outputs text (machine translation, translation hints, autocomplete, etc.) Memsource does not mingle customer data. Models are trained per customer and only from customer data or potentially complemented with publicly available data.</p>

<p>Redundant architecture ensures a high service up-time. All data is kept in several redundant database instances. All data is backed up through near real-time incremental backups as well as daily full backups to a highly durable storage hosted in AWS S3. Backups are encrypted using Linux LUKS (aes-xts-plain64:sha256) or AWS encryption (AES256).</p>

<p>We apply disaster recovery and incident response policies that ensure timely and effective reactions to incidents. Thanks to redundant architecture and rapid incident response we were able to reach 99.99% availability long-term. Thanks to a robust backup system, we are able to guarantee swift recovery and minimal data loss. The performance of our disaster recovery is measured by Recovery Time Objective (<span class="emphasis"><em>RTO</em></span>) and Recovery Point Objective (<span class="emphasis"><em>RPO</em></span>).</p>
<p> <span class="emphasis"><em>RTO</em></span> is the targeted duration of time and a service level within which a business process must be restored after a disaster (or disruption) in order to avoid unacceptable consequences associated with a break in business continuity. Memsource guarantees an 8 hour RTO for all components of its service.</p>
<p> <span class="emphasis"><em>RPO</em></span> is the maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time. It is the age of the files or data in backup storage required to resume normal operations if a computer system or network failure occurs. RPO covers incidents that require complete recovery of all database instances. In case only one database instance is affected by the incident, the production environment seamlessly switches to another instance. Memsource guarantees a 4 hour RPO even in case of a catastrophic failure.</p>
