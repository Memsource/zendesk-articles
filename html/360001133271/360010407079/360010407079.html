<h2>Fixed Bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>If a QA report contains a warning about the exceeded maximum length of translation within a segment, the info column is empty. The QA info column now provides numbers of characters exceeded and percentage of source information.</li>
<li>Links appearing in 'note' or 'usage' fields in TB matches did not function. Links now function as expected.</li>
</ul>
