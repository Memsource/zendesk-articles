<h2>New Features and Improvements</h2>
<p><strong>Linguists now Distinguished from Providers</strong></p>
<p>Linguists and Providers are now distinguished from each other in the Memsource UI. Previously, Memsource would ask users to select Linguists to be assigned to a job. However, this did not take into consideration that other vendors might be assigned to a job. The new UI distinguishes these two roles to help users to select the most appropriate person for a job.</p>

<p><strong>Adding Files from an Online Repository in Automation Widgets</strong></p>
<p>When an automation widget has connectors assigned, an <strong>Add from Online Repository </strong>button now appears. The button will only appear if the widget has connectors that are assigned.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Showing Quotes to the Assigned Providers</strong></p>
<p>Providers can now see how much they will get for a job in the <em>Quotes</em> section. Project Managers can assign the quote to a provider using the drop-down menu.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>New Connector—Contentful</strong></p>
<p>Memsource now supports Contentful as one of our connectors. You can establish a connection to it directly via Memsource and translate the following types of content:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spaces</li>
<li>Environments</li>
<li>Entries</li>
</ul>
<p>The connector supports both manual projects and <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003460931-Automated-Project-Creation">Automated Project Creation</a>.</p>
<h2>Fixed Bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Occasionally, jobs would not finish loading when uploading a zip file after a project's creation. This has now been resolved.</li>
<li>When multiple files were imported into a single project that had no workflow steps, the total price displayed would be correct, but sometimes the prices for the individual files would not be. This has now been resolved.</li>
</ul>
