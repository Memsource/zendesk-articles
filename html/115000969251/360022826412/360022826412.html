<p>At Memsource, we have a number of projects that we need to regularly localize into several languages. The source language is always English, and the target languages are German, Japanese, Russian, French, and many others. </p>
<p>Of course, we use Memsource for managing the whole translation process. Using our own product to run real-life translation projects helps us to better understand the needs of our users.</p>
<h2>The Memsource Website</h2>
<p>Over the past few years, we've switched our <a href="https://www.memsource.com">company site</a> backend from Drupal to WordPress, and now we are happy users of the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> static site generator. </p>
<p>Previously, we used our Drupal and WordPress <a href="https://www.memsource.com/integrations/">connectors</a> to manage the translations of the website into 3 languages, which worked very well. The main reason why we migrated to Jekyll this year was not related to localization. It was the slowness and the overall complexity of the previous WordPress setup which made a static site solution a preferable option.</p>
<p>Our stack consists of a Jekyll site which uses MarkDown and YAML files to generate the final static HTML files. The source MarkDown and YAML files are hosted in a private <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> repository, connected to three different systems which enable us to deploy, edit, and translate the website.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> runs Jekyll and deploys the whole site to make it available to our visitors. It is possible to have different Git branches running at different endpoints, so we are able to test new website pages and the translations before making them publicly available.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://forestry.io/">Forestry</a> is an online editor for Jekyll sites. Using Forestry, we can edit MarkDown and YAML, upload images, and access page previews.
</li>
<li>
Memsource is <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003460931-How-to-setup-and-use-Automated-Project-Creation">set up</a> to create new translation projects at regular intervals. The project creation step is followed by automated pre-translation. Everything that has been translated before is stored in a translation memory, including the context, and these translations are automatically inserted from the translation memory as part of the project pre-processing phase. Subsequently, individual linguistic tasks (translation, revision, etc.) are automatically assigned to our preferred vendors. Both MarkDown and YAML are among the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000446911-Supported-File-Formats">formats supported</a> by Memsource, which makes the whole translation process very smooth.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the translation process, Memsource provides us with a real-time overview of the progress, and we also receive e-mail notifications when the main project milestones are reached. Also, the <a href="https://www.memsource.com/app/">mobile app</a> makes it very easy for Project Managers and Linguists to track the progress of translation projects from anywhere. </p>
<p>After the translations are finished by the assigned vendors, the translated MarkDown and YAML files are pushed to the Git repository and are ready to be processed by Jekyll.</p>
<h2>Memsource and the Memsource Editor</h2>
<p>The main Memsource products use Java Properties files and <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/linguist-ts-file-format.html">Qt TS</a> files to display messages in Memsource user interfaces. Both file types are supported for translations in Memsource, so we only need to have a way to make the whole localization process automated, without any need for manual action by a developer or a localization manager.</p>
<p>As they implement new features or fix bugs, our developers only edit the English source files. The translated files in the other 15+ languages are either in a subdirectory or the same directory as the source file, depending on the particular development framework we use. </p>
<p>In the following example, "message.properties" is the English source file which we need to translate into Japanese, German, Spanish, Dutch, and other languages.</p>
<pre>assets<strong><br>i18n/<br>   messages.properties<br>   messages_ja.properties<br>   messages_de.properties<br>   ...<br>services</strong>
</pre>
<p>Developers in Memsource use an on-premise GitLab instance to track the source files and manage the whole development cycle.</p>
<p>To increase the security, we do not give our <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004326372-GitLab-Integration">GitLab connector</a> full access to the source code repositories. Instead, we have a separate Git repository in GitLab called "i18" which contains only the files that need to be localized. The connector in Memsource only has access to this single repository.</p>
<p>To synchronize the content of the primary source repositories with the "i18n" repository, we have a simple BASH script which is regularly executed by Cron.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Source repositories are updated by running "git pull".
</li>
<li>
English files are copied and pushed to the "i18n" repository.</li>
<li>Translated files are copied from to the "i18n" repository and pushed to the source directories.</li>
</ul>
<pre>bash<br>#!/bin/bash<br><br>workspace=/home/memsource/workspace<br>i18n=$workspace/i18n<br>web_i18n=$workspace/web/grails-app/i18n<br>te_i18n=$workspace/te/languages<br><br>function push_translated_files() {<br>   local project=$1<br>   local path=$2<br>   cd $path<br>   if [[ -n $(git status -s) ]]; then<br>       echo "commiting translated i18n files to $project"<br>       git commit -am "i18n updated [skip ci]"<br>       git push origin master<br>   fi<br>}<br><br># update all<br>cd $i18n<br>git pull<br>cd $web_i18n<br>git pull<br>cd $te_i18n<br>git pull
</pre>
<h3>Copy Translated Files to Projects </h3>
<pre># web<br>cp $i18n/web/messages_*.properties $web_i18n<br>push_translated_files "web" $web_i18n<br># te<br>find $i18n/te/ -type f -not -iname '*en_us*' -exec cp "{}" "$te_i18n" ';'<br>push_translated_files "te" $te_i18n </pre>
<h3>Copy New Source Files to i18n </h3>
<pre># web<br>cp $web_i18n/messages.properties $i18n/web<br># te<br>cp $te_i18n/TranslationEditor_en_us.ts $i18n/te<br># push<br>cd $i18n<br>if [[ -n $(git status -s) ]]; then<br>   echo "commiting new source files to i18n"<br>   git commit -am "new i18n uploaded"<br>   git push origin master<br>fi </pre>
<p>The translation management setup for the translations of the Memsource UI is the same as described above. Our Memsource account is set up to regularly create and pre-process new translation projects using the files from the "i18n" repository. After the translations are completed, they are automatically pushed back to the "i18n" repository by the connector, and then to the source repositories by the script. </p>
