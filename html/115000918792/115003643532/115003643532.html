<h2><span id="Internal_Spellchecker" class="mw-headline">Internal Spellchecker</span></h2>
<p>The Memsource Editor has an integrated spellchecker that supports many languages. In order to get the spellcheck service, the desktop editor must be online (a user must sign in). For more information, please check our detailed list of all <a class="mw-redirect" title="Languages Supported in MemSource Editor Spellchecker" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003929811-Supported-Languages">Memsource languages</a> and their spellchecker availability.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The spellchecker only supports spelling checks, not grammar checks.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><span class="mw-headline">In order to launch the spellchecker, press the </span><em>F7</em> key or click on <strong>Spellcheck </strong>in the <strong>Tools</strong> menu. All of the spelling errors will be displayed in the <em>QA</em> Pane. After correcting the misspelled word and confirming the segment, the user will be taken to the next segment with a misspelled word.  Alternatively, you can click directly on the segment in the <em>CAT </em>Pane to skip forwards and backwards through the text.</p>
<p>Any misspelled words will be underlined with a dotted red line. In order to view alternative spellings, hover your mouse over the red line. This will display a list of possible spellings as well as a red <strong>Add to Dictionary </strong>button at the bottom. Click on the correct spelling to insert it into the text. If the underlined word is correctly spelled, click the button at the bottom to add it to your dictionary. (<strong>Note:</strong> It will soon be possible to edit a user's dictionary.)</p>

<h3><span id="Ignore" class="mw-headline">Ignore a QA Warning<br></span></h3>
<p>When you run a Quality Assurance check (see the <em>QA </em>Pane section in our <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003643552-Panes#QA_Pane" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Editor Panes</a> article for more information), you can ignore a word without adding it to the dictionary by clicking in the "<strong>i</strong>" column of the QA pane. Doing this will show the misspelled word as "ignored" under QA, but the word itself will remain underlined in the target segment.</p>

<p>Any translation job can also be spellchecked in an external application that supports DOCX files, such as MS Word or Open Office Writer:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the Memsource project with the translation job you plan to spellcheck. Select the job, click <strong>Download</strong> and select the <strong>Bilingual DOCX </strong>option.</li>
<li>Open the bilingual DOCX file in, for example, MS Word, run the spellcheck, and do not forget to save the file afterward.</li>
<li>Return to your project in Memsource, click on <strong>Tools,</strong> and select <strong>Upload...</strong> to upload the spellchecked bilingual file.</li>
<li>After the upload, open your job in web editor and confirm all the segments that are not confirmed. You can do this by using the filter function at the top of your screen. Click on the arrow next to the <em>Filter Source Text </em>field and in the <em>Segment Status </em>section, select <strong>Not Confirmed.</strong>
