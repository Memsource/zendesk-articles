<p>All users of Ultimate and Enterprise editions can utilize the Language Quality Assessment (LQA) feature for conversations in the Memsource Editor. Users are able to leave LQA evaluations for a segment or its parts to provide feedback, in a way similar to how the comments feature works.</p>
<p><img class="img350" title="Adding LQA to a segment" src="https://pages.memsource.com/hc/Editor_addLQA.png"></p>
<p>Users can select one of the categories and subcategories that are set by the Administrator in the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002921632-LQA-Settings">LQA Settings</a> (for example <em>Accuracy</em>, <em>Fluency</em>, <em>Terminology</em>, etc.). Each of these categories can then be set to various levels of severity: <strong>Neutral</strong>, <strong>Minor</strong>, <strong>Major</strong>, or<strong> </strong><strong>Critical</strong>.</p>
<p>Segments with added LQA are marked with "Q" in the Conversation column.</p>
