<p>Jobs can be assigned to multiple providers—either Linguists or Vendors—when creating a new job, editing a job, or when using <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003483952-Project-Template" target="_self">project templates</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can add Linguists and Vendors to individual jobs or to batches of jobs. Select the job(s) you want to add Vendors to and click <strong>Edit.</strong>
</li>
<li>Select one or more Providers by clicking on their names. You can select any number of providers.</li>
<li>Drag the names to change the order of your Linguists or Vendors.</li>
<li>Use backspace or the <em>Delete</em> key to remove them.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can choose to notify all providers by email—either all at once or in selected intervals. On the same page where you add your files to your project, you'll see a <strong>Notify Providers </strong>checkbox and an <strong>Interval </strong>field above the <em>File Import Settings </em>section. Set your desired interval (ranging from all at once, to one every 24 hours) and click on <strong>Create.</strong></p>
<p>Assign Linguists and Vendors by clicking the checkbox next to your job and selecting <strong>Edit. </strong>Select as many providers as you'd like to notify about this project.</p>
<p>Once you have your provider(s) assigned to your job, select the job(s) you would like to send emails regarding. Click <strong>Tools </strong>and select <strong>Email... </strong>Once you do this, a new window will pop up where you can either select a template or type out an email yourself. You can send an email to one Linguist or Vendor, or to multiple Linguists and/or Vendors at the same time. </p>
<p>You can also select an email template to automate this process even further (you can create a new email template or modify an existing one in <strong>Settings</strong> by clicking on <strong><a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002921092-Email-Templates">Email Templates</a> </strong>in the <em>Administration</em> section). Use the default template to start with or create your own, using the available <a title="Template macros" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018778612">template macros</a> as variables for the Linguist name, your name, email address, and some additional information.</p>
<p>Once you've sent the email, the provider then can log in to their Memsource account and look at the job in the web editor in <em>Read-only</em> mode. The provider can then:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Accept the job:</strong> It will then become unavailable to other providers.</li>
<li>
<strong>Decline the job:</strong> If the provider declines, the provider's name will disappear from the <em>Providers</em> list. The job will still be available to the other providers.</li>
</ul>
