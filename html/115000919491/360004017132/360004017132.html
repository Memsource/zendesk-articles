<p>With the Memsource Mobile App, you can connect to your Memsource account on the go from your smartphone or tablet.</p>
<h2>Downloading the Mobile App</h2>
<p>The mobile app can be downloaded for free from both Google Play (Android) and the App Store (iOS).</p>
<h2>Logging In</h2>
<p>When you open the app for the first time, you will be asked to log in. Enter your Memsource username and password, or sign in with Google (if this is how you signed up for Memsource).</p>
<p>Don’t have an account yet? Visit our <a href="https://cloud.memsource.com/web/organization/signup?e=TEAM&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI9u_E_r-g2QIV8wrTCh2mmAqaEAAYASACEgLHv_D_BwE">sign up</a> page. If you are a translator, you should receive the login details from your Project Manager.</p>

<h2>Manage Multiple Accounts</h2>
<p>You can add multiple Memsource accounts to the mobile app and seamlessly move between them from the <em>User Account</em> page.</p>
<p>Select your profile picture/name at the top of your screen. Select <strong>Add Account</strong>, or choose another account to switch to it.  </p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you have multiple Linguist accounts, multiple Project Manager accounts, or a mixture of the two—they can all be added. You can add a maximum of 5 different accounts, but the app only supports Project Manager and Linguist user accounts.  </p>
<h2>Notifications</h2>
<p>Turn on notifications in your device operating system to receive Memsource notifications.</p>
<p>If the Project Manager checks the <em>Notify linguist</em> checkbox when a job is being created, our notification service will alert Linguists when they are assigned to a job. As a Project Manager, it will alert you when a job status has changed in a project you are managing or a job you are assigned to. You will receive a notification directly to your mobile phone or tablet, similar to the one below. When you select this notification, you will be taken directly to the mobile app. </p>

<h2>Viewing and Changing Your User Profile</h2>
<p>Would you like to change your Memsource profile picture? You can easily do this and view your other profile preferences directly in the Memsource Mobile App.</p>
<p>For Linguist users, press on the cog in the top right-hand corner to view your user profile.</p>
<p>For Project Manager users, select the three-line, "hamburger" button in the top left-hand corner and press <strong>User Profile</strong>.</p>
<p>Select <strong>Edit </strong>and take or choose a photo. You can also opt in or out of receiving the Memsource newsletter and sign out of the app. If you sign out of the Memsource Mobile App, you won’t receive any <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004017132#Notifications">Memsource notifications</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to make other changes to your profile (such as changing your password, etc.) this has to be done within the main Memsource page.</p>
<h2>Editing Jobs Using the Mobile App</h2>
<p>Once the app has been set up, Project Managers can use it to <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004017432-Mobile-App-for-PMs-Creating-New-Projects-and-Adding-Jobs" target="_self">create new projects and add new jobs</a>. Both PMs and Linguists/Vendors can also <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030651232" target="_self">edit</a> these jobs using the Editor. If a job is not accepted, completed or rejected by a Linguist, it can only be viewed in read-only mode by that Linguist.</p>
