<p>Under <strong>Setup,</strong> click on <strong>Access and Security. </strong>Here, users will find several options that are designed to create a better-controlled environment and to help manage the security of your data.</p>
<p><img src="https://help.memsource.com/hc/article_attachments/360021687791/mceclip0.png"></p>
<h2>Web Editor Enabled for Linguists</h2>
<p>This option helps Project Managers to control in which environment their Linguists and Ventors will be able to work. With this box checked, translators will be able to click on file names and open them in Memsource Editor for the web.</p>
<h2>Linguists May Download their Translation Jobs</h2>
<p>With this box checked, Linguists and Vendors will be able to <a href="https://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Memsource_Cloud_User_Manual/#Download">download bilingual content</a> for translation outside of Memsource. That is, translators will be able to download bilingual MXLIFF files, bilingual DOCX files, and TMX files for translation in the desktop editor.</p>
<h2>User Metadata Displayed to Linguists in Memsource Editor</h2>
<p>If you would like your Linguists and Vendors to be able to see who translated the TM matches they are getting, check this box. If you would rather have this data be anonymous, make sure this box is unchecked.</p>
<h2>Grant Access to Memsource Technical Support</h2>
<p>By default, Memsource Technical Support can access your account if you need help resolving a problem. If this would make you feel less secure, untick this option.</p>
<h2>Activate/deactivate Linguists and Vendors Automatically</h2>
<p>Some editions enable you to create an unlimited number of users and have them activated and deactivated automatically based on task assignment.<br>If you wish to make use of such automatic activation and deactivations, leave this option ticked.</p>
<h2>Use Vendors for Projects / Others May Discover my Organization as a Vendor</h2>
<p>Some editions of Memsource allow the use of Vendors that facilitate the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003691632-Shared-Projects">sharing and collaboration</a> of files across organizations. These two options allow you to make use of external translation providers or to work only with internal users.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Memsource has a <a href="https://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Job_Board">Job Board</a> that makes it possible for users to discover each other as potential partners. Checking the <strong>Others May Discover my Organization as a Vendor </strong>option will make sure that you are visible to others if you wish. If you do not wish to be visible to others, make sure this box is unticked.</p>
<h2>Linguists may Start a Workflow Step Only if the Preceding Step has Been Completed</h2>
<p>With this option, you control whether you want your translators and reviewers to work one after another, or if they will be able to work simultaneously. You will find more details about <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003484032-Workflow">workflow configuration</a> and the possibility to run workflow steps simultaneously in our Workflow article.</p>
<h2>Linguists may Edit Locked Segments</h2>
<p>With this option disabled, Linguists and Vendors will not be able to use the <em>F2</em> key to edit locked segments.</p>
<h2>Linguists may Edit Source</h2>
<p>This option controls whether or not linguists can edit the source text, including splitting and joining segments.</p>
<h2>Linguists may Turn On/Turn Off Auto-propagation of Repetitions</h2>
<p>Using this option, Admin and Project Manager users can choose whether Linguists and Vendors have the option to enable or disable the Auto-propagation of Repetitions feature in Memsource Editor.</p>
<h2>Session Timeout</h2>
<p>All users of an organization will be logged out of Memsource after a certain amount of time if they are idle. The time can be customized by Admin and PM users and can range from 15 minutes to 72 hours.</p>
<h2>Trusted IP Addresses (Available in Some Editions Only)</h2>
<p>Ultimate and Enterprise editions of Memsource allow you to ensure that your users can only their accounts from certain IP addresses. This is the section where you can define these trusted IP ranges. With this enabled, users will not be able to access their accounts from other locations, even if they have a valid username and password.</p>
<p>There is also "<label for="trustedIpOnlyForInternalUsers">Apply only to administrator and project manager users" </label>option if you want to define trusted IP addresses for your admin and project management team only, while leaving linguist users unaffected.</p>
<h2>Two-factor Authentication</h2>
<p>There is another important security-related feature which you will find under <strong>Setup</strong> by clicking on <strong>User Settings: </strong>Two-factor Authentication.</p>
<p>The Two-factor Authentication, also called Two-step Authentication, can considerably increase the security of your user account. This will be linked with <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&amp;hl=en">Google Authenticator</a>, <a href="https://authy.com/">Authy</a> or another compatible application on your phone.</p>
<p>Once it is set up, your account will be linked to the app on your phone, and when you sign in to your Memsource account, you will be prompted to provide your username, password and a code that you receive on your phone.</p>
<h3>To set up Two-factor Authentication:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Download Google Authenticator or a similar app to your smartphone.</li>
<li>In Memsource, go to <strong>Setup, </strong>click on <strong>User Settings</strong> and click <strong>Two</strong><strong>-factor Authentication.</strong>
</li>
<li>Scan the QR code with your phone, and the app will display a series of numbers (e.g. 123 456).</li>
<li>Enter the code from your phone into the <strong>Code </strong>field.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Verify.</strong> In order to do this, your phone must be connected to the internet.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the QR code is not displayed, the secret code will be shown, and you can type it into your phone instead of scanning the QR code.</p>
<p>If the code is correct, your account will be linked to the app on your phone. When you sign in to Memsource again, you will be prompted to enter your username, password and then one of the codes in your phone app.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Two-factor Authentication is no longer available for users who log in using a Google account as <span style="font-weight: 400;">2-Step Verification is already available for Google users</span>.
