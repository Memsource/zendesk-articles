<p>Using Automation Widgets is a secure and easy way to embed a <em>Submit files </em>functionality into a website or to use with your local intranet. Because they are useful in helping to automate some of the setup process, they not only save time but reduce human error.</p>
<p>The Automation Widget is essentially a URL that can be generated by a Memsource Administrator or Project Manager by going to <strong>Setup </strong>and clicking on <strong>Automation Widgets</strong> in the <em>Automation </em>section.</p>
<p>Clients (both internal and external) will be able to upload their files directly into Memsource, get quotes, and confirm their orders. The files are then automatically uploaded to a new Project in Memsource and are ready for translation.</p>
<p>When the translation is completed, the client can download the translated files using the provided link. For more details, please read our articles on <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003978132" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Net Rate Schemes</a>, <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003680771-Projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Projects</a>, and <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003483952-Project-Templates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Templates</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This feature is available for the <a href="https://www.memsource.com/pricing/" target="_self">Team Start</a> edition and higher.</p>

<h2>Features of the Automation Widget</h2>
<p>Once your Widget is set up, users will be able to open the web page containing your Widget and do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select source and target languages.</li>
<li>Select the service, if there is more than one provided (e.g. translating, reviewing, etc.).</li>
<li>Upload or drag and drop their files for translation. Files can also be removed as needed.</li>
<li>Upload files from an online repository, if set in the Widget. This is available only in the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003484392-Client-Portal-in-Memsource">Client Portal</a>.</li>
<li>Set their email address. Please note that the email address has to be verified once.</li>
<li>Set the time and due date.</li>
<li>Enter the Purchase Order Number.</li>
<li>Add a note.</li>
<li>Check the word count and the price.</li>
<li>Upload reference files.<br> Files can be uploaded as reference files by opening the <em>Reference Files </em>section of the Automation Widget and dragging your files into the box.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="img450" src="https://pages.memsource.com/hc/AutomationWidget_ReferenceFiles.png"></p>
<p>The project is then created automatically, and all files are imported as jobs—no Memsource login information is needed. The Project Owner (set in the Automation Widget) is automatically notified about the new Project through an email that contains the Project information and the Submitter's contact details.</p>
<p>Once the jobs are translated and the Project is set to <em>Complete</em>, the Submitter is notified by email and can download the translated files. This allows the Automation Widget to serve as a mini client portal.</p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>Because the Automation Widget is so easy and convenient to use, translation agencies can provide multiple Automation Widgets to their customers. These Widgets, in turn, allow translation agencies to receive more jobs from both internal and external clients. You will be able to distribute your Automation Widgets to any number of business units while still streamlining the internal translation process.</p>
<p>The Automation Widget is associated with <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001388091-Services" target="_self">Services</a> and can also be associated with a <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003483952-Project-Template" target="_self">Project Template</a>. This allows you to apply specific project settings, use a specific price list, translation memories for the analysis, term bases for terminology, choose certain Linguists, etc.</p>
<p>A Memsource organization can create any number of Automation Widgets. For instance, a translation company could create a single Automation Widget for its website or one for each of its major customers.</p>
<h2><span id="Setting_Up_the_Automation_Widget" class="mw-headline">Setting Up the Automation Widget</span></h2>
<p>Before you create an Automation Widget, you will need to have at least one <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001388091-Services">Service</a>. Services are used specifically in automatically created projects and let you set up the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001373812-Price-List">Price List</a>: Make sure the languages in the Automation Widget are set in your Price List, otherwise the Widget's price will be 0.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003978132-Net-Rate-Schemes">Net Rate Scheme</a> (optional): You can set a discount for TM matches, repetition or internal fuzzy matches</li>
<li>
<a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001334472-Due-Date-Schemes">Due Date Scheme</a> (optional): can calculate and pre-set a Due Date</li>
<li>
<a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003483952-Project-Templates">Project Template</a> (optional): The template will be used only if the selected languages in the Widget match the languages in the template.</li>
</ul>
<p>After you have at least one Service, you're ready to create your Automation Widget. Go to <strong>Setup, </strong>scroll down to the <em>Automation </em>section and click on <strong>Automation Widgets. </strong>Then, click on <strong>New.</strong></p>
<p><img class="img450" src="https://pages.memsource.com/hc/AutomationWidgetCreateNew.png"></p>
<p>Once you click on <strong>New, </strong>you'll need to fill in the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Name:</strong> Choose a name for your Widget. Please note that this name will not be displayed in the Widget itself.</li>
<li>
<strong>Service: </strong>This is where you'll select the services that your Automation Widget will perform.</li>
<li>
<strong>Automatically Select all Languages: </strong>Choose whether users should select languages manually, or if the languages should be selected automatically.</li>
<li>
<strong>Default Project Title: </strong>Template macros, such as {order.number}, {order.email} and {order.date} can be used to create project names.</li>
<li>
<strong>Allow users to specify Project Name: </strong>Choose whether users should be able to set a project title themselves from the Widget page, or if the project should be given a default name instead.</li>
<li><strong>Assign Widget to new Submitters</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Connectors: </strong>Select any connectors that you would like your Submitters to use. Note that the Submitter must sign in to the Memsource <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003484392-Client-Portal-in-Memsource">Client Portal</a> to use connectors; anonymous Submitters will not be able to use them.</li>

<p><strong>IFrame &amp; Appearance</strong></p>
<p>The <em>IFrame &amp; Appearance </em>section makes it possible to get the IFrame HTML Code and to customize the Widget itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>IFrame HTML Code: </strong>This is available only after a Widget has been created and can be used to easily embed the Widget into a website. This is explained in more detail below.</li>
<li>Customize the Widget's <strong>Background Color</strong>, <strong>Content Color</strong>, and <strong>Box Color </strong>using <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CSS color codes</a> or <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colornames.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CSS color names</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="img350" src="https://pages.memsource.com/hc/AutomationWidget_IFrame_Appearance.png"></p>
<p>After the Widget has been created, click on it and you'll notice a URL (web link) is displayed under the Widget's name. Distribute this link to your clients or anyone who needs to submit translation jobs to you. The link can be very easily embedded into a website, or you can choose to embed the entire Widget into your website. The section below explains how.</p>
<h2>Embedding the Widget into a Website</h2>
<p>There are three ways in which the Widget can be embedded into a website or an intranet page. The first two do not require any expert knowledge, while the last one should be handled by a webmaster.</p>
<h3>Widget URL</h3>
<p>Go to the list of your Automation Widgets, open the relevant one, and copy the URL text.</p>
<p>The URL can be used on any website or intranet page.</p>
<p><img class="img450" src="https://pages.memsource.com/hc/AW_link.png" alt="Widget-url.png"></p>
<h3>Widget IFrame</h3>
<p>The entire Widget form can be embedded into your website or intranet page. This will create a more seamless experience if you want to present the Widget as an integral part of your website. To do this, paste the <strong>HTML IFrame Code</strong> into your website, and that's it.</p>
<p>Note: You can also change the appearance of the Widget by setting custom colors. You can use names (black, red etc.) or numbers (#FF0000, #FFFFFF).</p>
<p><img class="img450" src="https://help.memsource.com/hc/article_attachments/360007303819/AW-Iframe-code.png" alt="Iframe-code.png"></p>
<h3>Widget IFrame with Resizing</h3>
<p>This a more advanced method of using the IFrame and Javascript for automatic resizing  - the Widget will resize when the Note or Paste Text fields are expanded. Without resizing support, the Widget's layout may be slightly altered, or a scroll bar may appear in the Widget. This will not affect the Widget's functionality, but it may not look as nice.</p>
<p>The Automation form uses the <a href="https://github.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer" target="_self">IFrame-resizer</a> Javascript library to provide the desired functionality and a clean and simple API.</p>
<p>Ask your webmaster to follow these instructions to embed the Widget IFrame with resizing support:</p>
<p>1. Have access to the JQuery library. You can do this by, for example, including the following HTML code in the &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; part of your web page:</p>
<pre>  &lt;script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<p>2. Have access to the IFrame-resizer library, again by including the following HTML code in the head section:</p>
<pre>  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="&lt;path-to-iframeResizer-parent-folder&gt;/iframeResizer.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<p>3. Provide an ID to the IFrame element and disable scrollbars. For example:</p>
<pre>  &lt;iframe id="memsource-iq" scrolling="no" ... &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</pre>
<p>4. Again, in the head section of your HTML, add the following HTML/Javascript code:</p>
<pre>  &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; $(document).ready( function () { $('#memsource-iq').iFrameResize({
  heightCalculationMethod: 'documentElementScroll' }); }) &lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<p>Here is a simple HTML page that implements all the steps above. It assumes the iframeResizer.min.js file is located in the same folder as the example HTML page:</p>
<pre>  &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; 
  &lt;html&gt; 
  &lt;head&gt; 
  &lt;script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="./iframeResizer.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; $(document).ready( function () { $('#memsource-iq').iFrameResize({
  heightCalculationMethod: 'documentElementScroll' }); }) &lt;/script&gt; 
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt; 
  &lt;div style="width: 530px; margin: 0 auto;" &gt;
  &lt;iframe id="memsource-iq"   scrolling="no" width="530px" height="400px" frameborder="0"
  src="https://cloud1.memsource.com/web/submitJob/1-soXGd-xgCbx?embedded=true"/&gt;
  &lt;/iframe&gt; 
  &lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;/body&gt; 
  &lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<p>If you require help with the correct placement of the IFrame-resizer library, please contact your webmaster to provide you with guidance.</p>
