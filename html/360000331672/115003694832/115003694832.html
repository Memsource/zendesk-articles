<h2>Before You Start</h2>
<p>It is essential to learn Memsource procedures and workflow to be able to understand and use Memsource APIs.</p>
<p>The basic workflow is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a TM, TB, and a machine translation engine (if you intend to use them).</li>
<li>Create a project with the TM/TB/machine translation engine attached (if needed).</li>
<li>Upload your file for translation to the project (also called creating a job in Memsource).</li>
<li>You can then analyze, pre-translate or assign the job to your Linguist.</li>
</ol>
