You have been assigned work in the {workflow.name} workflow step.
We would like to let you know that you can start now.

The linguist who was in charge of the preceding workflow step ({previousWorkflow.name})
has just changed status to Completed for the following job(s):

Project: {project.url}
{jobInfo}
File: {job.name}
Changed to: {previousWorkflow.name} - {job.status}
Language: {job.sourceLang} -&gt; {job.targetLang}
Due: {job.dateDue}
{/jobInfo}

Job in the preceding workflow step still not completed? Read more:

Let me know, if you have any questions.

Best regards,

{sender.firstName} {sender.lastName}
