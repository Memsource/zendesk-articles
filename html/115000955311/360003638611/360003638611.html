<div class="entry-content">
<p>The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a law to protect the data privacy rights of individuals. It goes into effect on May 25, 2018. The purpose of the law is to empower users with the ability to learn about and manage their data stored by companies.</p>
<p>In GDPR terminology, Memsource is a “data processor,” because you control the purpose and ends to which we process your data. Memsource has always taken data very seriously, and your personal data is no exception. To reflect our compliance with GDPR, we have updated our <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003054252-Terms-of-Service-effective-from-25th-May-2018-GDPR-">Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/sections/115000955311-Data-Storage-and-Security">Privacy Policies</a>, and encourage you to read them.</p>
<p>In the meantime, here’s a quick summary:</p>
<h2>Your User Data</h2>
<p>GDPR defines personal data as any information relating to an identifiable person who can be directly or indirectly identified in particular by reference to an identifier. In our updated Terms of Service, we describe exactly what user data we store, for what purposes, and how we guarantee security.</p>
<h2>Management</h2>
<p>We restrict and keep records of the Memsource employees who have access to your data. Those who do access it only do so as part of their work, ultimately to provide you with a better user experience.</p>
<p>At your request, we will delete your account and all associated information, including files, translation memories, term bases, or other content.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Memsource uses the latest internet technologies and strict policies to provide maximum security to Memsource users.</p>
<p>We store user data in a highly secured location using an advanced firewall and additional security technology to prevent unauthorized access. Specifically, Memsource is certified for ISO 27001. The Memsource application has also been audited by an independent security consultancy following the OWASP ASVS standard, and the connection to Memsource is secured by encryption and TLS 1.2. <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003830391-Security-Statement">Read more about Memsource security.</a></p>
<h2>Sub-processors</h2>
<p>Memsource only uses sub-processors following a contractual agreement guaranteeing GDPR compliance and strict data security policies. <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003072011-List-of-Sub-processors">See our current list of sub-processors.</a></p>
<h2>Memsource Preparation for GDPR</h2>
<p>We have appointed an internal GDPR team to learn, implement, and enforce compliance within Memsource. This, combined with a thorough training program for all employees and contractors will increase the company’s security culture.</p>
<p>We have revised our <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/sections/115000955311-Data-Storage-and-Security">legal policies</a> to reflect compliance.</p>
<p>We are checking partners and sub-processors for compliance.</p>
<p> Memsource will implement an annual audit program to ensure long-term compliance.</p>
<p> Any new solutions will take into account the new requirements for data security. At the same time, we are looking for the latest solutions in the field of data protection and will apply them to our processes, infrastructure solutions, and future endeavors.</p>
