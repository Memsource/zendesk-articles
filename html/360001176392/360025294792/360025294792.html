<p><strong>Terminology Between CSV files and LOG Files is </strong><strong>Now Consistent</strong></p>
<p>Previously, there was an inconsistency in the terminology used in analyses downloaded as <em>CSV</em> or <em>CSV with chars</em> files compared to those downloaded as <em>LOG</em> files. This has now been changed so that CSV file types use the same terminology as LOG file types.</p>
<p>Only two parameters needed to be changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Context TM</em> is now <em>Context Match</em>
</li>
<li>
<em>100% Matches</em> is now <em>100%</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> This change may have an effect on the way some applications process the CSV (Integration with Memsource). These applications must be updated accordingly.</p>
