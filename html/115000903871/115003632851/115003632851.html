<p>Upgrading the Memsource Editor is a completely automated process which requires no user action. Once a new version is released, Memsource Editor downloads it in the background. The next time the user starts it, Memsource Editor will open the upgraded version.</p>
<p>It is possible, however, that certain users may be running old versions. This can occur if they, for example, have not worked in Memsource Editor for a long time, and therefore the Editor could not be upgraded. Because of this, there is an additional check that will prompt a warning for the user to upgrade to the newest version manually if their current version is extremely outdated.</p>
