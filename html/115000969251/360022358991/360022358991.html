<h2>Bidirectional Text</h2>
<p>As the name suggests, this is text in a document that goes both left-to-right (LTR) and right-to-left (RTL). An example of this would be having English words going in a left-to-right direction in an otherwise Arabic text (that goes right-to-left).</p>
<p><strong>In Memsource:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Arabic, Hebrew, and other right-to-left languages are fully supported.</li>
<li>LTR and RTL text is automatically recognized in the Editors.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi-directional_text#Neutral_characters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neutral text</a> (numbers, spaces, dots, etc.) can be marked as RTL or LTR with special RLM or LRM characters in the Editor’s menu by clicking on <strong>Edit </strong>and selecting <strong>Insert Symbol</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>You must display hidden characters to see the mark in the Editor's target. Do this by going to <strong>Format</strong> and clicking on <strong>Display Hidden Characters.</strong></p>

<h2>Completed File</h2>
<p>The completed file carries the text-direction information within. While some applications can recognize it automatically (for example Microsoft Word), some applications do not support automatic recognition and the text direction must be set manually.</p>
<p>You can test your completed files by importing them back to Memsource to a project with RTL source language (Arabic, Hebrew...). If you open the job in the Editor, you will see the correct direction of the text.</p>
