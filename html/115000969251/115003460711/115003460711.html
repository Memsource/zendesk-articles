<p>Memsource supports <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003484032-Workflow">workflow steps</a>, and it is possible to export the changes made in each workflow step.</p>
<p>In the Project, select a job you want to export, go to <strong>Tools</strong> and select <strong>Export Workflow Changes.</strong></p>

<p><br> You will find this feature especially useful if you want to provide anyone involved in the translation chain with a summary of the source and all versions of the translations across workflow steps. For example, you can provide the translation, revision, and final review. You will get an HTML table with the original text in the first column and then a separate column for each workflow step.</p>
