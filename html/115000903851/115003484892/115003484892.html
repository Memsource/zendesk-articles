<p>Memsource offers its users the choice of two <span style="color: #333333;">translation workbenches</span>.<br>Below you will find a short comparison that will help you to understand which one is best suited for your specific needs.</p>
<h2>Limitations set by Project Managers</h2>
<p>Project Managers can actually limit the Linguists’ access to translation editors. By going to the <strong>Security </strong>section and clicking on <strong>Access and Security </strong>in the <em>Project Settings </em>section, they can decide if Linguists will only be able to use one of the Editors or another.

<h2>Memsource Editor for Desktop</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/sections/115000903871-Desktop-Editor">Memsource Editor for desktop use</a> is a combination of a local installation and online connectivity. It can be downloaded and installed for free for <a href="https://www.memsource.com/en/download">Linux, Mac, and Windows</a>.</p>
<p><br>In order to translate in the Desktop Editor, you will also need to download an MXLIFF file from your project. Open it in the Editor, and make sure you enter the server URL, username, and password under <em>Login</em>. After you do this, the indicators in the bottom right corner will turn green. You will then be able to access the TMs and TBs attached to the project online. In addition, all your translations will be synchronized with Memsource in real time.</p>
<p><br>When offline, the <em>CAT Results</em> pane will not display any results from the TMs or TBs, and your translations will not be sent to Memsource. However, you can continue translating/editing and as soon as you come online again, the Editor will automatically synchronize all your translations with Memsource.</p>
