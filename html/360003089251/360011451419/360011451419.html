<h2>New Features and Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Empty segments are pre-translated upon tapping to open in the mobile editor.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fixed Bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>On Android devices, long-pressing text with tags would sometimes wrongly expand the selection to only partially include the tag. This has been fixed - the entire tag will be included inÂ  the selection or not at all.</li>
<li>On some iPad devices, the Toolbar at the top is overlapped with the Search field. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>On Android devices, inserting CAT results into styled text did not apply the correct styling to the inserted CAT result. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>On Android devices, text styling (like bold, italics and etc.) was sometime incorrectly applied. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>Changing timezones resulted in infinite alerts. This has been fixed.</li>
