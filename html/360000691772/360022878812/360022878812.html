<p>Git connector allows the downloading of source files and uploading of target files directly from/to the Git repository. Memsource clones the remote repository locally and uses git commands to communicate with the remote repo.</p>
<h2>Git Connector Use Cases</h2>
<ul>
<li>Project Managers can <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003483992" target="_self">add files directly to projects from an online repository</a>. View changes submitted since the last commit by clicking the <strong>show</strong> link in the middle of the screen.</li>
<li>Set up the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003941812" target="_self">Automation Widget</a> so Submitters can add files to requests directly from the online repository. View changes submitted since the last commit by clicking the <strong>show</strong> link in the middle of the screen.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003460931" target="_self">Automated Project Creation</a> to have Memsource automatically create new projects when a new commit is detected in monitored files, folder, or an entire subdirectory.<br>
<ul>
<li>Selected files are imported the very first time APC runs. No files are imported when a folder is monitored</li>
<li>This connector supports absolute path setting. Note that the target translation files can be stored only in the same branch as the source file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set up <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015039031" target="_self">Continous Jobs</a> to have Memsource monitor selected files for changes.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://cloud.memsource.com/web/docs/api#tag/Connector" target="_self">Connector API</a> can be used to automate steps otherwise performed manually through the UI. <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004209771" target="_self">Webhooks</a> can be used to have Memsource notify 3rd party systems about certain events (for example, a job status change).</li>
</ul>
