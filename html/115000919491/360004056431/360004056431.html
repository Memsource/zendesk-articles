<p>The mobile app provides extensive search and filtering capabilities for users.</p>
<p>Project Manager users can search and filter projects and jobs in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select a category on the <em>Project</em> Dashboard page (for example, <em>My Overdue Projects</em>), and use the search bar to search by project name.</li>
<li>Select a project and press <em>Jobs</em>. Use the search bar to search for jobs within that project. To narrow the search, use the filtering options. You can filter by status, target language, and due date.</li>
</ul>
