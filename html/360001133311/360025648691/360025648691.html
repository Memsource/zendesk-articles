<h2>Fixed Bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Due to a bug, the CAT Pane would sometimes stop providing results for translation memories, term bases, and machine translation. This issue has now been fixed.</li>
<li>When a comment is added to a segment, and then that segment is split, the comment appears on the second segment. Due to a bug, any subsequent comments made on the first segment would show up on the second segment instead. This has now been resolved.</li>
</ul>
