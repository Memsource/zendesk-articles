<p>If you want to select multiple jobs that appear on different pages, the solution is to use the filter feature that is available in the <em>Jobs</em> section.<br> <br> For instance, if you need to analyze files that are assigned to a specific Linguist, you can do this first by filtering the files so that only ones assigned to that Linguist are shown, and then launching the analysis of these files.</p>
<p>If you still get more than one page of jobs after applying the filter, follow these steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Select all of the jobs on the first page of the filtered results. (You can do this by selecting<strong> </strong>the checkbox at the top.)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Once you do this, a new checkbox will appear called <strong>Select all jobs. </strong>This will allow you to select all filtered jobs, even though they are across multiple pages.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Launch the analysis.</p>
