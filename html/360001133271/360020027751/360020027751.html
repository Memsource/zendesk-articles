<p><strong>Marking QA Warnings as Unignorable</strong></p>
<p>It has always been possible for translators to ignore any warning presented in the QA check. However, this could have caused problems reported by end customers, more work for Project Managers, or overall failure to download the completed file altogether.</p>
<p>Project Managers can now specify which QA warnings cannot be ignored and therefore need to be resolved before a QA check is completed. This option (combined with the <em>"Linguists may not set jobs with QA warnings to Completed"</em> option) can help increase the quality of translations as well as decrease the unnecessary errors introduced during translation.</p>
