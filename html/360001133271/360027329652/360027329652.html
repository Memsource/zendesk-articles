<h2>New Features and Improvements</h2>
<p><strong>Term Level Metadata in Memsource Editor for Desktop</strong></p>
<p>With the introduction of additional term metadata, the way of displaying the metadata in the Memsource Editor is modified accordingly in order to provide the same information needed for localization. The design of metadata for TM and MT changes as well.</p>
<p>The <strong>Note</strong> and <strong>Usage</strong> fields have been removed from the <strong>Add Term</strong> window in order to centralize all the metadata manipulation into the cloud interface where all the other information can be specified as well. </p>
