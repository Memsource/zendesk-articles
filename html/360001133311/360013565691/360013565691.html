<h2>New Features and Improvements</h2>
<p><strong>Approved Terms Visually Indicated</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until now, it was only possible to distinguish between </span><em>New</em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em> </em>and </span><em>Approved </em><span style="font-weight: 400;">terms using the metadata details at the bottom of the <em>CAT</em> Pane. With the release of this feature, </span>New<span style="font-weight: 400;"> terms will be marked in grey.</span></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Marking Terms as Preferred</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As in Memsource, it is now possible to mark terms as </span><em>Preferred</em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when creating them from within the Memsource Editor for Web. The preferred translations can be identified by their designation at the bottom of the <em>CAT</em> Panel (in the metadata section).</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fixed Bugs</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to a bug in the web editor, only the first occurrence of a term was highlighted in each of the segments. This has now been fixed.</span></li>
</ul>
