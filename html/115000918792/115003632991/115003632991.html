<p>The Memsource Editor for the web is our completely web-based translator's workbench. It is available to all Memsource subscribers. No installation or any other special PC settings are needed, and it can also be used on tablets. Unlike the Memsource Editor for your desktop, it cannot be used when a user is offline. If your Internet connection is not stable and fast, please use the desktop editor instead. Using the Memsource Editor for the web is recommended for smaller jobs of up to 10,000 segments (40,000 segments is the limit).</p>
