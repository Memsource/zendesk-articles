<p>Bitbucket Cloud is similar to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bszH1app2MYdRu-QxOfRxF0TnWCCRNH-NQT0D5nlGBw/edit#">Bitbucket Server</a>, but is different in terms of authentication and access. Below, you’ll find instructions on how to integrate your Bitbucket Cloud account and your Memsource account.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You will need to have pop-ups enabled in your browser in order to successfully connect your accounts.</p>
<h2>Configure Bitbucket Server</h2>
<p>Before setting up the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003948452-Connectors">connector</a> in Memsource, you’ll want to log in to your Bitbucket account in order to create a personal access token. This will be used later in Memsource. To create this token, click on your profile picture and select <strong>Manage account </strong>from the dropdown list.</p>

<p>Under Account settings, select <strong>Personal access tokens</strong> and then click the <strong>Create a token</strong> button. Enter a <em>token name</em> (this can be anything). Then, set the permissions as follows: Project—<em>Read</em>, Repositories—<em>Write</em>. Then, click <strong>Create.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Important: </strong>When the pop-up window with the password appears, copy and save it somewhere, as it will not be displayed again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The last thing you’ll need is your Bitbucket Server account’s URL. This will be everything in the address bar up to the first slash (<strong>/</strong>). Copy this and save it alongside your personal access token.</p>

<h2>Set up the Connector in Memsource</h2>
<p>In Memsource, navigate to Setup and scroll down to the <em>Integrations </em>section. Click on <strong>Connectors.</strong> After clicking on <strong>New</strong>, you can choose the connector you wish to create. Give it a name and change the Type to <em>Bitbucket Server.</em></p>

<p>Enter your <em>Bitbucket site URL </em>and your personal access token into the fields provided and click <strong>Test Connection.</strong> If you've entered everything correctly, a little check mark will appear. Then, click <strong>Save.</strong></p>
