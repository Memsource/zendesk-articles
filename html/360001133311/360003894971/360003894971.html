<h2>New Features and Improvements</h2>
<p><strong>Insert Tags Using Shortcut With Tag Number </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Memsource users can now specify the tag number and position of the tag in the target segment by selecting <em>CTRL+ALT+ tag number</em> (or <em>Cmd+Option+tag number</em>, if you are using a Mac).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This new shortcut makes handling tags a lot more flexible and faster.  Up until now, the only options for handling tags were to use the shortcut <em>F8</em> (or by selecting </span><strong>Insert Tag</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the <strong>Edit</strong> menu) to add the numbered tags into the target segment in the same order as the source text, or manually copying and pasting the tags. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, users can add tags to the target segment in any order. To insert a paired tag, you can either insert them one after another, or you can highlight both parts of the paired tag by pressing the keyboard shortcut together with the respective tag number. </span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Mac OS, there was a bug that meant multiple segments couldn’t be locked at once using the shortcut <em>CTRL+L</em>. This has been fixed.<br></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users were not able to lock segments (and carry out other operations) when sorting options in the web editor were activated. This bug has been fixed.</span></li>
