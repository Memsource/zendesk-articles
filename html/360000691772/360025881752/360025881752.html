<p>HubSpot lets you create blog posts, ebooks, websites, landing pages, forms, and files to help attract buyers. Using Memsource, you will be able to translate your content by either manually uploading it or by using   <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003460931-Automated-Project-Creation">Automated Project Creation</a> to initiate jobs based on rules that you define in a<span style="color: #9900ff;"> <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003483952-What-is-a-Project-Template-">Project Templa</a><a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003483952-What-is-a-Project-Template-">te</a><span style="color: #9900ff;">. </span> <font color="#404040"> This article provides a step-by-step guide to setting up and using the Memsource extension for HubSpot.</font></span></p>

<p> <font color="#404040"> <strong>Note:</strong> You need to have pop-ups enabled in your browser in order to connect.</font></p>
<p><font color="#404040">Before setting up the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003948452-Connectors" target="_self">connector</a> in Memsource, you'll want to log into your HubSpot account. Being logged into Hubspot will allow Memsource to get your account information during the setup process. </font> </p>
<p> <font color="#404040"> Navigate to Memsource and log in. Go to the main <strong>Setup </strong>and scroll down to the <em>Integrations </em>section. Click on<strong> Connectors</strong>. After clicking on <strong>New,</strong> you can choose the connector you wish to create. Give it a name and change the <strong>Type </strong>to <em>HubSpot. </em>Then, click <strong>Connect to HubSpot.</strong> </font></p>
<p>After you click <strong>Connect to HubSpot, </strong>a pop-up window will appear. You'll see a list of the possible HubSpot accounts that you can connect to (there may be only one). Once you click on your account, the window will close and you'll be brought back to your Memsource account. You'll see a small checkmark next to the <strong>Connect to HubSpot</strong> button. Click <strong>Save.</strong></p>
<h2>Troubleshooting:</h2>
<p>Some websites and landing pages may contain "Custom Modules". Due to limitations in the HubSpot APIs used to extract content, these are currently not supported by our connector. Therefore, these custom modules will need to be extracted and translated separately.</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> The HubSpot connector does not currently support the translation of ebooks at this time.</p>
