<p><strong>T-4OO MT Engine Now Added to Memsource</strong></p>
<p>The T-4OO Machine Translation engine is now available to use in Memsource.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Punctuation is No Longer Included in Wordcounts</strong></p>
<p>In order to increase the accuracy of wordcounts, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Thai documents will no longer have punctuation marks included in the wordcounts. This will apply to general punctuation (U+2000 - U+206F), supplemental punctuation (U+2E00 - U+2E7F), and to CJK symbols and punctuation (U+3000 - U+301F only). Please note that this will only apply to Analyses initially, and will apply to the Memsource Editor in the October 30th release.</p>

<p><strong>New Fields Added to Quote Reports</strong></p>
<p>In order for our users to see their project's information more conveniently, <em>Submitted by, Project due date, Project status, </em>and <em>Project status changed </em>fields have been added to quote reports. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Fewer Jobs Shown per Page</strong></p>
<p>To help decrease the loading time of larger projects, the number of jobs per page will be decreased to 50.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="New_Features_and_Improvements">Fixed Bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Due to a bug, the Cost Center was not always displayed in the Project Template settings. This has now been fixed.</li>
<li>When two or more Linguists were assigned to a job and one accepted, the second Linguist would sometimes get a <em>Job Status Changed</em> notification before receiving a <em>New Job </em>notification. This has now been resolved.</li>
</ul>
