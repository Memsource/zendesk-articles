<p>Jobs can be found in each project. Each job represents a file for translation into a specific target language. If a file is to be translated, for example, from German into English and Italian, two jobs will be created:</p>
<ul>
<li>Job 1: Translation of the file into English</li>
<li>Job 2: Translation of the file into Italian</li>
</ul>
<h2>Import Files for Translation</h2>
<p>See our article on <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002825692-Creating-a-new-job">creating a new job</a> for details about importing files for translation, supported file formats, file import settings, and file import limits. </p>
<h2>Edit the Job</h2>
<p>A Project Manager can edit a job's parameters, including the <em>Status, Assigned Linguists and/or Vendors, </em>and <em>Due Date</em>. Jobs can also be cloned to another target language within the project. See our article on how to <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002826032-Editing-of-job-s-parameters">edit a job's parameters</a> for more details, or read the section on job history in our <a title="Memsource Cloud User Manual" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003680771-Projects#Job_History_1">Projects</a> article to learn how details of the job can be displayed. You can also learn more about how to <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019276732" target="_self">assign more than one Linguist or Vendor</a> to a job. </p>
<h2>Join Files</h2>
<p>When downloading multiple bilingual files, a dialogue window will pop up, asking the user whether the files should be <a title="Join Files" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003961951">joined</a> or zipped.</p>
<h2>Download Files</h2>
<p>A Project Manager can download the original file, bilingual files for translation, completed (translated) files, and can also export the completed files back to online repositories. See our article on <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002826692-Downloading-files">downloading files</a> article for further details.</p>
<h2>Analyze Jobs</h2>
<p>Single or multiple jobs can be analyzed for wordcount or translation memory matches. See the details in the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002826872-Analysis">analysis</a> article for more information.</p>
<h2><span id="Pre-translate" class="mw-headline">Pre-translate</span></h2>
<p><span class="mw-headline">Both Linguists and Project Managers can pre-translate a job using translation memories, Machine Translation (if available) or use AI non-translatable pre-translation on the jobs. See our <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002841231-Pre-translate-jobs">pre-translate jobs</a> article for more information.</span></p>
<h2><span id="Tools" class="mw-headline">Tools</span></h2>
<p>Clicking on the <strong>Tools </strong>button will give you several options. Each of these is detailed below.</p>

<div class="thumb tright">
<div class="thumbinner">
<div class="thumbcaption">This feature lets you notify your Linguists of translation jobs that you have assigned to them. Once you have a provider assigned to your job, select the job(s) you would like to send emails regarding. Click <strong>Tools </strong>and select <strong>Email... </strong>Once you do this, a new window will pop up where you can either select a template or type out an email yourself. You can send an email to one Linguist or Vendor, or to multiple Linguists and/or Vendors at the same time.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>You can also select an email template to automate this process even further. (You can create a new email template or modify an existing one in <strong>Settings</strong> by clicking on <strong><a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002921092-Email-Templates">Email Templates</a> </strong>in the <em>Administration</em> section.) Use the default template to start with, or create your own using the available <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" title="Template macros" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018778612">template macros</a> as variables for the Linguist name, your name, email address, and some additional information.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Split File...</span></p>
<p>This command allows translation files to be split into sections. It is particularly useful if there are multiple translators that need to work on a file. The <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000259451-Split-File">Split File article</a> explains in more detail how this option works. </p>

</div>
<p> </p>
<p>The cloning of jobs is available only in projects with multiple target languages.</p>
<p>With the Cloning feature, Project Managers can upload a job to only one of the target languages in a project, prepare it (copy source-to-target non-translatable segments, confirm and lock them, or just lock segments which should not be touched) and then select this job and <strong>Clone</strong> it into the other target languages. When cloning jobs, PMs can assign Linguists and select the "Notify" option in the same manner as when creating new jobs.</p>
<p>The following information will be copied into the cloned job:</p>
<ul>
<li>The segment's<strong> target</strong> (Any target in the first job will be cloned—both non-translatable and translatable.)</li>
<li>The segment's<strong> status</strong> (confirmed, locked)</li>
<li>The segment's <strong>Repetition exception</strong><br><img class="img350" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wufd5hs60jo5wsh/clone_job_editor.png?raw=1">
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also possible to clone a Split Job. When you do this, the new job will be split in the same way as the original file. </p>
<p>When cloning a Workflow step (instead of the whole job), the segments in higher steps will not be confirmed. However, the target, lock, and repetition exceptions will be copied.</p>
<p><strong>Important: The comments/conversations are NOT cloned!</strong></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Export Workflow Changes</span></p>
<p>When exporting workflow changes, what you'll receive is an HTML multi-column table with columns for the source text and for the translations in all <a class="mw-redirect" title="MemSource Cloud User Manual" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003484032-Workflow">Workflow steps</a>. Each Workflow step is compared to the previous one. All changes are displayed using a <em>track changes </em>feature.</p>

<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Extract Terms...</span></p>
<p>The Terminology Extraction feature makes it possible to extract terms from selected jobs in a project. You can only extract terms from the source text.</p>
<p><img class="img250" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/5qbg8plu06ukibb/Extract-terms-options.png?raw=1"></p>
<p>The following terminology extraction options are available (and displayed before terminology extraction is launched):</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximum length in words</li>
<li>Minimum frequency</li>
<li>Minimum word length</li>
<li>Ignore words containing numbers</li>
</ul>
<p>Terms will be extracted into an MS Excel file that can be further edited and/or directly <a class="mw-redirect" title="MemSource Cloud User Manual" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003681851-Term-Bases#XLS_Import_Format_1">imported as an XLSX file into a term base</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Terminology extraction is not supported for Chinese, Japanese, Thai, or Korean. </p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Upload</span></p>
<p>This feature allows users to upload translated bilingual files (both MXLIFF and Memsource bilingual DOCX files) back to their original jobs. Chrome and Firefox both support the uploading of multiple files.</p>
<p>The option settings:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Save all segments into the TM</li>
<li>Save only confirmed segments</li>
<li>Do not save any segments into the TM </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Only bilingual files exported from the job in Memsource can be uploaded back into the job.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Assign Providers From a Template</span></p>
<p>Using this feature, Project Managers can assign providers (Linguists or Vendors) to each Workflow step using a project template. See our article on how to <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002827852-Assign-Providers-from-a-Template">Assign Providers from a Template</a> for more information.</p>
<h2><span id="Delete" class="mw-headline">Delete</span></h2>
<p>The <strong>Delete</strong> button deletes selected jobs from a project. Deleted jobs as well as other deleted items can be recovered from the recycle bin.</p>
