<h2>Opening a Job in the Editor</h2>
<p>After you <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004017132-Mobile-App-Getting-Started-for-Project-Managers-and-Linguists" target="_self">set up</a> the app, open it and select a project from the Project Dashboard. Choose the job you want to work on. After <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004056371-Mobile-App-for-Linguists-Reviewing-Jobs-and-Changing-Job-Status" target="_self">accepting the job</a>, scroll down and select the <strong>Open in Editor</strong> button.</p>
<p><img class="img250" title="Open job in Mobile Editor" src="https://pages.memsource.com/hc/Mobile_OpenEditor.png" alt="Open job in Mobile Editor"></p>
<p>Once you open the job, you’ll see a list of all the segments. You'll also see two progress bars—one on the top and one on the bottom of the screen. The top progress bar shows the percentage of confirmed segments, and the bottom bar shows the number of all segments in the job.</p>

<h2>Translating the Segments</h2>
<p>Once you open the job, you’ll see the list of segments that need to be translated. Tap the segment you want to translate and begin editing. After you’ve typed your translation, press the <strong>Tick</strong> (Android) or <strong>Done</strong> (iOS) key on your keyboard. This will confirm the segment. The next segment will automatically load. When the last segment has been translated, you’ll see a notification telling you that there are no more segments to translate. Once you see this notice, tap <strong>Cancel</strong> in the top left corner to return to the list of translated segments.</p>

<p>If you need to unconfirm a segment, select the segment, tap on the Menu icon in the top right corner, and select <strong>Unconfirm.</strong> Click on <strong>Done</strong> to reconfirm the segment.</p>
<h2>The CAT Pane</h2>
<p>If your job has a term base, a translation memory, or machine translation associated with it, these will all be available in the Editor's CAT Pane. As you translate each segment, you’ll notice a blue "Resources" icon in the bottom right corner. Tap it and you’ll see the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003642952" target="_self">CAT Pane</a> with the list of available matches.</p>
