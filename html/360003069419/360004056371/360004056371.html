<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you first log in as a Linguist user, you will immediately be taken to the jobs dashboard, which will look something like this:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://help.memsource.com/hc/article_attachments/360005117751/mceclip0.png" width="212" height="363"></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The dashboard provides an overview of all the jobs you are currently assigned to and the status of each. <span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the </span><em>New<span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span>Accepted,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><em>Completed</em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> statuses which are used in Memsource, the Mobile App also includes </span><em>Overdue Jobs<span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span>Due in 24 hrs</em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><em>Cancelled Jobs</em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, making it easier for you to prioritize and plan your work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you select any of these sections, you will be taken to a list of the relevant jobs. You can search this list using the search bar, or narrow the search further by using the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004056431">filter options</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Note:</strong> When you log in as a Project Manager, you will be taken to a <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004017292">Project Dashboard</a>. </span></p>
<h2>Reviewing Jobs</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve received a notification saying that a job has been assigned to you, it’s important to respond as soon as possible. With the Memsource Mobile App, you can review all the key details about a job and even view the original source file even, if you</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> don’t have your computer with you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key information about a job can be seen in the <em>Jobs</em> list. If you want to find out more, select the job. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To see the original source file, press the three dots (<strong>...</strong>) in the top right-hand corner. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">From this Job detail page, you can also change the status of jobs (see the next bit below). </span></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> With an iOS device, you can preview the file from the app. With an Android device, you need to download and open the file.</p>
<h2>Accepting, Declining, and Marking Jobs as Complete</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve reviewed the source file, you can choose to either accept or decline the job. If you accept the job, you can then <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030651232" target="_self">edit</a> the job in the Memsource Mobile app. Once the job is complete, you can also set the job to <em>Completed</em>.</span></p>
