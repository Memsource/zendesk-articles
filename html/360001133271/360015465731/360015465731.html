<p><strong>Approved Terms for Easier Identification</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the release of this feature, </span><em>New </em>terms will be marked in grey while the <em>Approved</em> terms will remain black. This is already available in the Web Editor. </p>

<p>Until now, it was only possible to distinguish between <em>New</em> and <em>Approved</em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">terms using the metadata details at the bottom of the CAT pane:</span></p>

<p><strong>Marking Terms as Preferred and Having Preferred Terms Displayed First in CAT Pane</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Desktop Editor now supports marking terms as </span><em>Preferred</em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when creating a term base entry. Also, a preferred target term for a source term will be positioned above any other term associated with that source term in the <em>CAT</em> Pane.</span></p>
