<p><strong>Instant QA Available </strong></p>
<p>When using <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003484052-Quality-Assurance#instant-qa-settings-0-5" target="_self">Instant QA</a>, segments are run through the quality assurance checks immediately upon their confirmation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Changes Made to the "Unedited Fuzzy Match" QA Check</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Unedited Fuzzy Match </em>QA check has been divided into <em>Unedited TM Fuzzy Match </em>and <em>Unedited NT/MT Fuzzy Match</em>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Adjustable Font Size in Tag Editing Box</strong></p>
<p>The font size in the Tag Editing Box can now be changed in the same way as the font in the Translation Table.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Shortcuts for Em and En Dashes</strong></p>
<p>While users can still use Alt+0151 to create an em dash (—) or Alt+0150 for an en dash (–), users can also use keyboard shortcuts to create these dashes. Using CTRL+ALT+the minus sign will create an em dash, and using ALT+the minus sign will create an en dash.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>En Dashes and Em Dashes No Longer Count as Words</strong></p>
<p>In order to help users get a more accurate word count, em dashes and en dashes are now no longer counted as words.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="New_Features_and_Improvements">Fixed Bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Due to a bug, text in some segments would incorrectly be shifted and the cursor would appear to be in the wrong place. This has now been resolved.</li>
<li>When clicking out of the Conversation window, it would sometimes disappear. The conversation window will now stay open when a user clicks out of it.</li>
<li>While links would work in Context Notes, the images in the URL would not always be displayed properly. This has now been fixed.</li>
<li>When using the mouse to resize the bottom panel, the splitter would sometimes keep following the mouse instead of releasing properly. This has now been resolved.</li>
<li>Due to a bug, using Ctrl+Shift+Space would not always create a non-breaking space. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>Previously, it was not always possible to bulk set repetition exceptions in a job. This has been resolved.</li>
