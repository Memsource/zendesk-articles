<p><strong>Choose Characters that Should Not Be Escaped in MD Files</strong></p>
<p>When working with MD files, users can now decide which of the characters should not be escaped when the translated MD file is exported from Memsource. This can be especially helpful with more complicated MD structures or formattings.</p>

<p>Mirai Translator is now supported as an MT engine in Memsource.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Remove All Non-Memsource Tags Renamed</strong></p>
<p>When importing a Translation Memory, the option <em>Remove all non-Memsource tags</em> has been renamed to the more general title <em>Remove tags</em>, but the functionality has remained intact.</p>

<h2>Fixed Bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>If a user accepted a split job (where other users have been assigned as well), others had been incorrectly removed from their respective jobs. This bug is now fixed.</li>
<li>Projects, TMs, and TBs whose name contained an underscore (_) had not been correctly filtered by it. This has now been resolved.</li>
<li>The rate in the <em>Job Report</em> was incorrectly rounded to 2 decimal points. This has now been fixed.</li>
