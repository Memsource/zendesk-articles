<h2>Fixed Bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>When using a Mac, the interface would sometimes change to dark mode. This issue is now fixed.</li>
<li>After ignoring the QA checks and then confirming segments, the previous segment would sometimes be incorrectly selected. The next segment is now properly selected instead.</li>
<li>When checking word counts in both the web and desktop Editors, the word count would sometimes be different between the two. This has now been resolved.</li>
</ul>
