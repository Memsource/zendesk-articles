<p>Microsoft OneDrive is a file hosting cloud-based service that lets you easily store your documents. Below, you’ll find instructions on how to integrate your OneDrive account with Memsource.</p>
<p>Please note that this connector only supports Microsoft OneDrive. OneDrive for Business is not supported at this time.</p>
<h2>Set up the Connector</h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You will need to have pop-ups enabled in your browser.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before setting up the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003948452-Connectors">connector</a> in Memsource, you'll want to log in to your OneDrive account. Being logged into OneDrive will allow Memsource to get your account information during the setup process.</p>
<p>Navigate to Setup and scroll down to the <em>Integrations </em>section. Click on <strong>Connectors.</strong> After clicking on <strong>New</strong>, you can choose the connector you wish to create. Give it a name and change the Type to <em>Microsoft OneDrive.</em></p>

<p>If you haven’t logged into your Microsoft OneDrive account yet, you’ll see a pop-up asking you for your OneDrive login information. If you are already logged in, this step will be automatically skipped.</p>
<p>The pop-up you see will now ask you to allow Memsource to access the information in your OneDrive account. Click on <strong>Yes. </strong>Once you’ve done this, you should see a small check mark next to the <strong>Connect to OneDrive </strong>button. Click on <strong>Save.</strong></p>
