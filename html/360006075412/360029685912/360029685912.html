<h2>Shared Jobs Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003691632">Sharing</a> jobs was the next logical step after the introduction of <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003691632">shared projects</a>. Shared projects work really well if a project is shared with a single external Vendor. When multiple Vendors need to be used for a project, the solution is to use shared jobs.</p>
<p>For instance: </p>
<ul>
<li>A corporate Memsource customer (Buyer) can share jobs within a project with multiple Vendors where different Vendors are responsible for different target languages.</li>
<li>Or, a Buyer can pick a lead Vendor and share the project with them. The lead Vendor can then decide to work with multiple sub-Vendors and uses shared jobs for them. (This would be a combination of a shared project and shared jobs within the same project.)</li>
<li>An MLV (Multi-Language Vendor) can assign jobs to SLVs (Single-Language Vendors). Again, this is typically based on target language specialization.</li>
<li>It is possible to share a project with one Vendor and share jobs in the same project with another Vendor. However, sharing the project and its jobs with the same Vendor is not possible.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting Started with Shared Jobs</h2>
<p>Once you've established the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003691632#Vendor_Connection">Vendor Connection</a>, you can assign any job to any Vendor in the same way you would assign the job to your Linguist:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the job.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Edit.</strong>
</li>
<li>Select one or more <strong>Providers</strong>—the Vendors will be listed next to your Linguists. Hover your mouse over the name to see the tooltip.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Shared Jobs Rights</h2>
<p>Shared jobs are much more Buyer-driven. This means that Vendor rights in a shared job are quite limited in comparison to shared projects where Vendors enjoy almost all Project Management rights.</p>
<h3><strong>Buyer Rights</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The Buyer has full Project Management rights in a shared project.</li>
<li>The Buyer is not able to see the names of the Vendor's Linguists but can see the job's status set by the Vendor's Linguist.</li>
<li>The Buyer can neither see nor access the Vendor's TM and TB (if the Vendor added any to the job).</li>
<li>The Buyer is not able to edit the Vendor's Analysis or use it to create a Quote.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Vendor Rights</strong></h3>
<p>The vendor rights are quite limited in a shared job.</p>
<p><strong>The Vendor may:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>See only the jobs assigned to the Vendor by the Buyer.</li>
<li>See analyses assigned to the Vendor by the Buyer (that the Buyer created).</li>
<li>Add their own Memsource TM.</li>
<li>Add their own Memsource TB.</li>
<li>Split and join jobs.</li>
<li>Create analyses.</li>
<li>Assign shared jobs to the Vendor's Linguists.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Vendor may not:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>See jobs that are not directly assigned to them.</li>
<li>See Buyer's analyses that are not assigned to them.</li>
<li>Delete jobs.</li>
<li>Change the settings of the Buyer's translation memory or term base within the project.</li>
<li>Edit or export Buyer's TMs/TBs.</li>
</ul>
