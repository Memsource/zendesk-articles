<p>Bitbucket Cloud is similar to <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028286132" target="_self">Bitbucket Server</a> but is different in terms of authentication and access. Below, you’ll find instructions on how to integrate your Bitbucket Cloud account and your Memsource account.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You will need to have pop-ups enabled in your browser in order to successfully connect your accounts.</p>
<h2>Configure Bitbucket Cloud</h2>
<p>Before setting up the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003948452-Connectors">connector</a> in Memsource, you’ll want to log in to your Bitbucket account to make sure it’s set up properly.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <strong>Your Profile and Settings </strong>in the lower-left hand corner and select <strong>Bitbucket Settings. </strong>
</li>
<li>Under <em>Access Management, </em>select <strong>App Passwords</strong> and click on <strong>Create app password. </strong>
</li>
<li>Enter a label (this can be anything).</li>
<li>Then, set the permissions as follows: Account—<em>Read</em>, Projects—<em>Read</em>, Repositories—<em>Write, Admin</em>. When you’re finished, click <strong>Create.</strong>
</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Important: </strong>When the pop-up window with the password appears, copy and save it somewhere, as it will not be displayed again.</p>
<h2>Set up the Connector in Memsource</h2>
<p>In Memsource, navigate to Setup and scroll down to the <em>Integrations </em>section. Click on <strong>Connectors.</strong> After clicking on <strong>New</strong>, you can choose the connector you wish to create. Give it a name and change the Type to <em>Bitbucket Cloud.</em></p>
