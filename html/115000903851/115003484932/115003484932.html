<div>The In-context Preview feature offers a real-time preview of original or translated text directly in the Memsource Editor and is available in all Memsource editions.</div>

<div>The Memsource Editor supports real-time, in-context previews<strong> </strong>for the following file types:</div>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Word</li>
<li>Microsoft Excel (including Multilingual files)</li>
<li>Microsoft PowerPoint</li>
<li>Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>XML with style sheets (including Multilingual files)</li>
<li>RTF</li>
<li>DITA</li>
<li>Markdown</li>
<li>IDML (Beta version)</li>
</ul>
<p>If a file type is not supported, the following notification will appear: "In-context preview was not generated". If this happens, you can download a preview of the translated file by going to the <strong>Document</strong> menu and clicking <strong>Preview Translation</strong>.</p>
<h2>Setup in Editors</h2>
<p>The In-Context Preview can be found by clicking on <strong>Tools </strong>and selecting <strong>Preview </strong>in the Memsource Editor menu bar. From here, users have the option to activate or deactivate the preview window. There is also the option of viewing either the source text (showing the original, unchanged text while translating) or the target text.</p>

<div>The window can be resized and rearranged like all panels/tabs in the Memsource Editor. If the target segment in the translation grid is empty, the target preview will show the original text. However, as soon as editing starts, it is shown in the target preview, which reflects any changes made in the translated segments on a real-time basis.</div>
<h2>Using the In-context Preview While Translating</h2>
<div>Users can navigate from the translation grid to the preview window and vice versa. When a user clicks on a segment to be translated, the respective text in the preview window is highlighted, showing the position of the translated segment within the document. Similarly, when a user clicks on text within the preview, the translation grid jumps to the corresponding segment to be edited straight away. The preview also helps while running the QA—if a user clicks on a warning, it navigates them to the position within the document.</div>

<h2>Preview for InDesign Files</h2>
<p>It is possible to Preview PDFs of your IDML files in Memsource Editor, but only with <a class="external text" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003692532-Setup#Frontlab_1" rel="nofollow">Frontlab Integration</a>. This is not a live, in-context preview, but thanks to this feature users are able to generate a PDF-based preview of translated IDML or INDD files. In order to generate the preview, navigate to <strong>Document </strong>in your Memsource Editor, then <strong>Preview Translation</strong>.</p>
<p>While for all other formats this functionality will generate the preview file in its original format, if the document under translation is IDML or INDD, Memsource will generate and open a PDF preview.</p>
