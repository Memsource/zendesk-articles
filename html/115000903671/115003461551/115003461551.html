<p>Business Units are available in the Ultimate and Enterprise editions and provide additional customization of rights. They can also provide a division of users into separate groups (sub-organizations or departments) within a single Memsource account.</p>
<p>Unlike the Client metadata field (which was used to limit user rights to certain resources before the introduction of Business Units), multiple Business Units can be selected to provide access to more than one area within an account.</p>
<p>Currently, user rights can be restricted for the following three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>​Projects</li>
<li>Project Templates</li>
<li>Translation Memories</li>
<li>Term Bases</li>
</ul>
<p>Business units can also be combined to provide all kinds of different setups. <br> <br> <img style="width: 400px; height: 561px;" src="https://help.memsource.com/hc/article_attachments/115004126472/import-811970.jpg" alt=""></p>
