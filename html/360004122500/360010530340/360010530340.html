<p>We built our company by listening to customers. </p>
<p>Memsource is a comprehensive software platform used by thousands of organizations. That means we receive a lot of valuable feedback and suggestions. Unfortunately, we cannot follow through on every suggestion and we need to say ‘no’ more than we would like to.</p>
<p>While we don’t publish our product roadmap, we do want to be transparent about how we handle your feature ideas.</p>
<p>This policy does not apply to bugs.</p>
<h2>How to Submit a Feature Idea</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While you can submit your idea directly on the </span><a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/community/topics"><span style="font-weight: 400;">feature idea forum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we recommend that you first discuss the idea with our support team by opening a </span><a href="http://get-help.memsource.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">support ticket</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Select <em>New feature request</em> as the <strong>Request type</strong>.</li>
<li>Ensure all the details about the feature are included. Provide examples or use cases to demonstrate the need for the feature.</li>
<li>CC the Solution Architect or Customer Success Manager if you have one assigned.</li>
<li>Create separate posts for separate feature requests. This is very helpful in providing better tracking.</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you post the idea directly to the forum, our support team reviews the idea to see if it is relevant before making it public. If it is a valid feature idea, then the post is published.</span></p>
<h2>What Happens After Submitting an Idea</h2>
<p>Our support engineer may:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask for additional information.</li>
<li>Propose an alternative approach or a workaround.</li>
<li>Find out if the development isn’t already in place.</li>
<li>Determine that the request cannot be accommodated.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the support team confirms the proposed idea is valid it is published on the forum for others to comment and vote on. The original support ticket is then closed.</span></p>
<h2>How We Prioritize Feature Ideas</h2>
<p>We take a number of factors into consideration when prioritizing future development, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product strategy - ideas need to be aligned with our long-term strategic vision.</li>
<li>Demand - are there other customers who proposed the idea or would benefit from similar functionality?</li>
<li>Level of effort - simple ideas have shorter implementation time than complex features.</li>
<li>Availability of our team and resources.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Track What Is Happening to a Proposed Idea</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the proposed idea is prioritized by the product team, its status changes to Planned. Depending on the complexity of the implementation, it may take between one to three quarters to complete it. The status of the post will be updated to Completed once the feature is released to production. </span></p>
