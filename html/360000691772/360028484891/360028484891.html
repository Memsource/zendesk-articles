<p>Confluence is a collaboration tool that helps users to create pages, blogs, and notes. This article will give step-by-step instructions on how to connect your Confluence account to Memsource.</p>
<h2>Set up the Connector</h2>
<p>Before setting up the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003948452" target="_self">connector</a> in Memsource, you'll need to log into your Confluence account. Click on <strong>Spaces </strong>in the bar at the top of your browser, and select the name of the Space you want to use.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You'll need to use the name in the <em>Spaces </em>dropdown menu and not the name displayed at the top after clicking on your Space.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You'll also need to copy the <em>Host </em>name. This will be the URL in your Confluence website up to the first slash (<strong>/</strong>).</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Once you have the name of your space and the Host name, navigate to Memsource and log in. Go to <strong>Setup </strong>and scroll down to the <em>Integrations </em>section. Click on<strong> Connectors</strong>. After clicking on <strong>New,</strong> you can choose the connector you wish to create. Give it a name and change the <strong>Type </strong>to <em>Confluence.</em></p>
