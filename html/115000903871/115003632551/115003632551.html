<div class="thumb tright"> The <em>Search Pane</em> displays search results from:</div>
<ul>
<li>The translation memory</li>
<li>The term base</li>
</ul>
<p>This type of search is sometimes referred to as a "concordance search." To launch the search, click on <strong>Tools </strong>and then <strong>Search TM/TB</strong>. You can also select any text from the source column and launch the search for that particular string by pressing CTRL+K (fuzzy search) or CTRL+SHIFT+K (exact search). Alternatively, press CTRL+K to open an empty search pane and type manually.</p>
<p>If you click on the result of your choice, the text will also be visible at the bottom of the search pane. From here, you can copy and paste the results.</p>
