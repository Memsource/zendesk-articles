<p>Project Managers and Administrators can prevent Linguists and other Vendors from editing the source either in the Editor or via our UI or API. The option <strong>Linguists may edit source</strong> (selected by default) is located in the <strong>Access and Security</strong> section in the project as well as in the global settings. If the option is deselected, Linguists are no longer allowed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit the source language in the Editor. When pressing <em>F2</em>, the message <em>"Source edits disabled by project owner." </em>will be displayed.</li>
<li>Upload bilingual MXLIFF or DOCX files. This includes any source modification in the Memsource UI, API, or Editor. When attempting to do so, the message <em>"Source edits prohibited by project owner. Upload failed."</em> will be shown.</li>
<li>Joining and splitting segments also count as source modification that will be prohibited.</li>
</ul>
